  Hello, and welcome to the R section of the Software Carpentry bootcamp.

  <h2>R is...</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    An environment for performing statistical analysis
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Software for data visualisation

    A programming language

    So for those of you who have never encountered R before, what is it? R is a statistical programming language which is used to:
     - process and analyse data
     - visualise data, and generate publication quality graphics
    It is also a programming language, allowing you to:
     - develop analysis pipelines
     - develop new statistical methods
    It is also a free open-source project, making it completely free to download and extend.

  <h2>Why R and not &lt;X&gt;?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    Prepackaged with common statistics and methods
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    If something is missing, there's a package for that!
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    So why use or learn R for data analysis, instead of another language or platform?
    Not only does R come prepackage with pretty much any statistical model or test you can think of,
    but its also easy to extend and install add-on packages.

  <h1>Packages</h1>
  <p>Contains cutting edge research</p>
  <ol class="fragment"> 
    <li>5000+ add on packages in CRAN</li>
    <li>800+ on Bioconductor</li>
    <li>100+ on github</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="notes">
    As a result its used by researchers and industry all over the world, 
    not only for their analyses, but also for method development. This means that R is cutting edge, new methods are often available
    in R long before they're implemented in other languages or platforms.
    In November last year, there were more than 5000 statistical and general purpose packages available in CRAN, along with many domain specific
    packages like those specific to life sciences research.
    <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/cran-now-has-5000-r-packages/" alt="Source for Statistics">source</a>
    Now this might seem like an intimidating number of packages, but there is a central list called "CRAN Task views" which maintains a list
    of packages grouped by task, so you can often go there if you only have a vague idea of what you need, or are exploring options in terms of
    functionality you need to solve a given problem.
