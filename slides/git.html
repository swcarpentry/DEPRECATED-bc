  <h1>Version Control with Git</h1>
  <aside class="notes">
    Over the next hour, we will introduce you to version control with Git.
    Version control is:
    <ol>
        <li> A record of what you and your collaborators have done,
        <li> A way to see what's changed, and
        <li> A way to "blame" people for what they did.
    </ol>
    The sense of humor is also very corny...
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>What It Is</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> A way to store and synchronize code (or any files).
    <li class="fragment">
        Documents collections of changes <em>upon your request</em>.
    <li class="fragment">
        Keeps your work safe and up-to-date <em>across machines</em>!
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
      The important thing is the general concept of version control, but we are
      using Git because it has become the standard among open-source developers,
      and strong hosting options are available (GitHub and BitBucket).

  <h1>A common approach...</h1>

  <aside class="notes">
      Currently, the image doesn't always format properly. Sorry about that.
      @gvwilson said he may be able to fix it?
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Other problems we can solve</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Imagine multiple copies of important code and data across machines:
    <ul>
        <li> Which copy has “the fix”
        <li> Sharing with yourself can be hard, but 
        <li> sharing with others is downright treacherous
    </ul>

    <li class="fragment"> What if there’s a conflict?
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Perfectly reasonable (but actually harder)</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        Cloud storage<br>
        +<br>
        well-considered naming schemes<br>
        =<br>
        Maybe good enough?
    </p>
    <p class="fragment" style="text-align: center">
        How do you manage files now?<br>
        NB: you are still getting work done, right?
    </p>
  <aside class="notes">
      Have a serious, brief discussion with students. Some of them will be using
      good practices. Every time someone mentions something useful, explain how
      Git ensures or automates it.

      This provides the highest level overview of the structure of Git on one
      machine.

<section>
    <h1>Git solves a lot of problems at once</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> A record of what you and your collaborators have done
      <li class="fragment"> A way to see what’s changed
      <li class="fragment"> A way to “blame” people for what they did
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Note the odd humor again in "blame"

      There are two points here: if you don't explain what you're doing, you
      won't know later. But also, don't let your desire not to write a commit
      message stop you from making a snapshot of your work!

<section>
    <h1>Sharing history</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> The history is a permanent record of what happened (across copies of
           the repository)
      <li class="fragment"> Put another way: the history is what we copy when we
           copy a repository
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h1>Syllabus</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Working directly with remote repositories
        <li>Making "clones"
        <li>Adding and committing your work
        <li>Looking at history with diff and log
        <li>Pushing your work back to a remote
        <li>Pulling updates from a remote
      </ol>
  <aside class="notes">
    We will only explore the basics in this lesson.  Our real goal is to teach
    you how version control works and how best to use it.  While many of our
    images were from web comics, one was from a very useful guide:

        http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/

    which is good both as a tutorial and as a reference.
