  <h2>Python is...</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    a popular and easy to learn scripting language
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    a tool to generate figures
  </p>

    So for those of you who have never encountered Python before, what is it? Python is a programming language which is used to:
     - develop analysis pipelines
     - process and analyse data
     - visualise data, and generate publication quality graphics
     - develop new statistical methods
    It is also a free open-source project, making it completely free to download and extend.

  <h2>Tasks that Python could help you do:</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    Transform your data files from one arbitrary format to another.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Analyze image files.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Loop through all the files in a driectory, perform an analysis on them, and plot the results.

  <h2>Why Python and not ...</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
    Perl? <br>
    It is easier to read and easier to learn. Also, popularity matters! If Python is what your collaborators are using it, may be a good idea for you to learn it too.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Javascript or Ruby? <br>
    There are good numerical libraries and people are actively developing other packages and tools.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    MATLAB or SAS? <br>
    It's free.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    R? <br>
    Depends on the task at hand. R has some advantages in statistics and visualization, Python is better at manipulating text and handling big data.
