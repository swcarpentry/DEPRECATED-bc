    Hello, and welcome to Software Carpentry.

  <p>
    We make scientists and engineering more productive
    by teaching them basic computing skills.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Our goal is to make scientists and engineers more productive by teaching them fundamental computational skills.

<section>
  <h1>Problem</h1>
  <p>
    Surveyed 1972 scientists in 2008.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    "How do you use computers?"
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    "How did you learn what you know?"
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Let's start with a few facts.
    In 2008, almost 2000 scientists responded to an online survey that we organized.
    We asked them, "How do you use computers?"
    And, "How did you learn what you know?"

<section>
  <h1>Problem</h1>
  <p>
    Scientists spend 40% of their time building or using software.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    55% say this figure is rising.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    <em>96% are mostly self-taught.</em>
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    They told us that on average they spend about 40% of their time building or using software.
    53% told us that this number is going up.
    And an astonishing 96% told us that they are mostly self-taught.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Problem</h1>
  <p>
    No hard data on how <em>well</em> they do things.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    But anecdotal evidence suggests "not very".
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We weren't able to get any data on how productive or effective they are.
    But the evidence we do have suggests that everything seems to take longer and hurt more than it should.

<section>
  <h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>
    Intensive hands-on training.
  </p>
  <div class="fragment">
    <img src="{{page.root}}/img/mozilla-science-lab.png" alt="Mozilla Science Lab logo" />
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    Software Carpentry is the solution.
    We run intensive two-day classes that give scientists and engineers those fundamental skills
    as part of the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a>.

  <h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>
    Two full days of instruction.

      the Unix shell
      <br/>
      Git and GitHub

  <aside class="notes">
    Two full days covers the basics of the Unix shell, version control with Git, programming in Python or R, and using SQL.
    What we're really showing them though, is how to automate repetitive tasks,
    how to track and share their work,
    how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way,
    and the difference between structured and unstructured data.

  <h1>Outcomes</h1>
  <p>
    20% improvement in productivity is common.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    10X isn't rare.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We can often save people 20% of their time - a day a week -
    and it's not unusual for attendees to report a tenfold savings.
  </aside>

<section>
  <h1>Outcomes</h1>
  <p>
    Empowers people.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    HPC, the cloud, web services, big data, ...
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Reproducible research, open science, ...
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We also give people the technical skills they need to make use of
    high-performance computing, the cloud, and other new possibilities,
    and to play an active role in changing the way science itself is done.

<section>
  <h1>The Details</h1>
  <p>
    Materials are all open access.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Instructors are volunteers.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    Only cost is travel and accommodation
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    (but contributions to central costs are welcome).
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Our notes and examples are all freely reusable under open licenses,
    and our instructors are all volunteers,
    so the only cost to host sites is travel and accommodation
    (though we are grateful for contributions to central costs).

    Increase both numbers 50% in 2014.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    We ran almost 100 two-day workshops for over 3500 people in 2013 alone,
    and hope to increase both numbers by half in 2014.
