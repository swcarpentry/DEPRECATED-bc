    Hello, and welcome to the R section of the Software Carpentry bootcamp.
    In this section, we will introduce you to the R Statistical programming environment.

  <h2>What Is It?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">
     A <strong>free</strong>, open source statistical analysis package, a language, and a way of life.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
     A number of sophisticated analyses are available straight out of the box.
  </p>    
  <p class="fragment">
    A full-featured programming language that allows development of cusomized analysis pipelines and more specialized packages.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    A staggering number of free, specialized packages that extend core functionality.
  </p>   
  <p class="fragment">
    A rich environment for data visualisation
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    A great community - R Geeks are everywhere!

  <h2>Why R and not another language or platform?</h2>
  <aside>
    Not only does R come prepackaged with pretty much any statistical model or test you can think of,
    it's also easy to extend and install add-on packages.  R is used by researchers and industry all over the world, 
    not only for their analyses, but also for method development. This means that R is cutting edge, and new methods are often available
    in R long before they're implemented in other languages or platforms.
    All of this makes R one of the most flexible and sophisticated options available
    for statistical analysis. The learning curve can be a bit steep at first, but once
    you master the basics you will be amazed at what you can do!
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Packages</h1>
  <p>Contain cutting edge statistical methods</p>
  <ol class="fragment"> 
    <li>5000+ add on packages in CRAN</li>
    <li>800+ on Bioconductor</li>
    <li>100+ on github</li>
  </ol>
  
  <aside class="notes">
    As of November 2013, there were more than 5000 statistical and general purpose packages available in CRAN, along with many domain specific
    packages like those specific to life sciences research.
    [<a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/cran-now-has-5000-r-packages/" alt="Source for Statistics">source</a>]
    This might seem like an intimidating number of packages, but there is a central list called "CRAN Task views" which maintains a list
    of packages grouped by task. You can often go there if you only have a vague idea of what you need, or are exploring options in terms of functionality you need to solve a given problem.

  <h1>Basic functionality</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Import and manipulate common data formats such as .txt, .csv. xls
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Transform and analyze data using a broad array of built-in functionality
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Basic data summaries and visualization, often in a single command
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Basic R skills will eliminate the need for other statistical or data management
    software, giving you access to common analyses and visualization methods with no
    additional packages needed.  The learning curve can be somewhat steep for users
    who have never done any programming before, but the added flexibility and repeatability
    afforded by a more "hands-on" approach to stats are well worth the effort, even
    if you don't take advantage of R's extended functionality.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Extended functionality</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Import and manipulate less common data formats (e.g., GIS data formats, image 
      stacks from medical imaging systems) using freely available libraries
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Huge base of user-created packages for specialized applications
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Generate publication-ready plots of any type you can imagine using
      extensive plotting and visualization libraries
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Automate, innovate, and share with the community
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Learning to code R well can open up a wealth of new opportunities for you.  You can
    do a better job of analyzing your own data, and save yourself time and money. When 
    you start to get really good at it, you can also contribute to the endlessly-growing 
    capabilities of R itself, allowing other scientists to use your home-grown
    analytical methods on their own data.

<section>
  <h1>R as a programming language</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      New tools/ procedures can be written in R, shared and used by others.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Open-source and R packages
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Integration with other tools
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Don't know what a function does? Look at code yourself!
    Don't agree with how a function works? Re-write it!
    Extend R with more functions, data and graphics. CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) 
    has >5000 packages and Bioconductor has almost 1000 packages.

    Access MySQL database (RMySQL).
    Google Maps API (RGoogleMaps).

<section>
  <h1>Reproducible Research</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>
		What if someone questions your analysis five years from now?  
		Will you remember what you did?
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      R scripts record the commands you use to analyze your data, so you can inspect and repeat them later.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Analyses done in GUIs are usually NOT reproducible - maybe you can 
      get a result easily, but will you remember HOW you did it when it comes
      time to write the paper or reanalyze the data?
    </li>
    
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    R code is written in a plain text file. Running the same code on the same data should reproduce
    the exact same results. R "scripts" are easily shared. "Latex, Knitr, Sweave" etc allow seamless 
    integration of R output into a self-documenting report.

    We will only explore a dozen or so commands in this lesson.
    Our real goal is to teach you how R works
    and how best to use it as a tool for reproducible research and statistical analysis.
    There are many online tutorials available for R.
    If you'd like to know more,
    we recommend
    <em>C Gandrud's Reproducible Research with R and RStudio</em>, 
    <em>Dynamic documents with R and knitr</em> and
