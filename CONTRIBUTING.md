Contributing Boot Camp Material
===============================

Software Carpentry is an open source/open access project, and we
welcome contributions of all kinds.  By contributing, you are agreeing
that Software Carpentry may redistribute your work under
[these licenses][licenses].  Please see [this page][creators] for
a list of contributors to date.

Workflow
--------

Software Carpentry uses a development workflow similar to that of
[AstroPy][] and many other open source projects. The AstroPy docs have
excellent sections on:

* [Getting started with git][astropy-git]
* [Developer workflow][astropy-workflow]

File Formats
------------

### Text

Text documents should be in [Markdown][] format and compatible
with [Redcarpet][], the engine GitHub uses to render Markdown.

### Slides

The preferred format for slide presentations is still to be determined.
