As a species,
we know a lot about how brains learn,
how effective various teaching practices are,
and how society's needs and expectations shape how and how well we learn.
As individuals,
though,
most people who teach at college and university either don't know this knowledge exists,
or haven't incorporated it into their teaching.
It's as if only doctors knew about the connection between smoking and cancer.

The best guide to evidence-based learning we have found is
*How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching*
(see the bibliography for the full citation).
Its advice,
summarized below,
is based in equal parts on theory, research, and experience.
While some of the recommendations may seem banal,
the full-length explanations in the book itself are anything but.

> 1. Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
> 
> Students come to courses and other learning situations with knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes
> gained in the rest of their lives.
> This knowledge influences how they filter and interpret what they are learning.
> If students' prior knowledge is accurate, and is switched on at the right times,
> it provides a strong foundation for building new knowledge.
> On the other hand, when that knowledge is inert, wrong, insufficient, or switched on inappropriately,
> it will interfere with learning.
> 
> 2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and how they apply what they know.
> 
> Students naturally make connections between different bits of knowledge.
> When those connections form structures that are accurately and meaningfully organized,
> students can retrieve and apply their knowledge faster and more accurately.
> When knowledge is connected in inaccurate or random ways,
> on the other hand,
> they either won't retrieve it or will apply it inappropriately.
> 
> 3. Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.
> 
> Motivation is critical in guiding the direction, depth, and persistence of learning.
> When students think a learning goal or activity is valuable,
> when they expect to achieve a desired learning outcome,
> and when they believe their environment is supportive,
> they are more likely to learn.
> 
> 4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.
> 
> It's not enough to have individual pieces of knowledge;
> students must also practise combining them in order for practice to become fluent and automatic.
> To do this,
> students must learn when and how to apply their skills and knowledge.
> Instructors therefore need to be conscious of the "when" and "how" as well as the "what"
> in order to help students.
> 
> 5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning.
> 
> Learning happens best and fastest when practice focuses on specific goals,
> is challenging without being overwhelming,
> and is repeated often enough for lessons to sink in.
> Practice must be coupled with feedback that explicitly tells students how they are doing relative to specific targets;
> this feedback must include specific information to help students improve,
> and this information must be given prompty after performance so that what students did is fresh in their minds.
> 
> 6. Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.
> 
> Students are not disembodied intellects:
> they have social and emotional lives.
> They are growing and maturing as people throughout their lives,
> and while teachers cannot control this process,
> teachers must establish a classroom climate that supports it.
> 
> 7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.
> 
> Students should use a wide variety of meta-level techniques to monitor and control their learning:
> assessing the task at hand,
> evaluating their own strengths and weaknesses,
> planning their approach,
> applying and monitoring various strategies,
> and double-checking whether their chosen approach is working.
> However, most students don't do these things naturally.
> Teaching them to do so improves their current performance,
> and also the long-term effectiveness of their learning.

We try to incorporate these ideas into our teaching,
and into our [instructor training course](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org).
