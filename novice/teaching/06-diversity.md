Allyship Tips
=============

By Kara Woo and Matt Davis:

* Listen. When people talk about their lives and experiences, take them seriously. They are the experts.
* Do your homework; don’t expect others to educate you. Some people may be happy to do this, but you are not entitled to it. Many, many people have written on diversity issues — it’s not hard to find information.
* Learn to call out discrimination, bias, and unfairness when you see it, whether it is intentional or not (but also be wary of monopolizing conversations).
* Support victims of harassment by believing them, and do not blame them or try to minimize their experiences by telling them to 'just ignore' their harassers.
* Elevate the voices of members of marginalized groups.
* Be conscious of your own language and actions and the ways they might reinforce systems of oppression and privilege.
* Don’t center your own feelings. If you get called out or feel wounded by someone else’s tone, go back to point #1.
* Remember that “ally” isn’t a static identity, nor is it a label you get to claim for yourself. Allyship is a process, and you’re not an ally just because you say you are. Do the hard work of being an ally, and don’t expect to be thanked or acknowledged every time (or even most of the time).

As Katy suggested education about stereotype threat would be good.
http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/

Talking about unconscious bias would be good too.

In addition to the fact that we're talking about fundamental rights, we could bring up that diverse teams do better work.

On the topic of what not to do, the Women in Astronomy blog had an
excellent series of posts recently on sexual harassment. They are
collated here: http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/2014/05/aaswomen-newsletter-for-march-16-2014.html

1. A NYT article on microaggressions: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/us/as-diversity-increases-slights-get-subtler-but-still-sting.html?_r=1
2. This book, Whistling Vivaldi, was a key part of the reading I did in preparing to write the series of posts on stereotype threat: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393339726/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=17WPNNQ56GKFJ&coliid=IDHZ9U4RO0SX
3. This NYT Magazine article talks about efforts at UT-Austin aimed at improving retention and graduation rates:
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-gets-to-graduate.html?hp&_r=1

1. Some of the discussion focused on how to handle tricky situations in the classroom. One suggestion (from Ann Curzan in English) is to focus on the language. For example, “The words you just used might give the impression that you think…” She recommended this video, entitled how to tell someone they sound racist:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc&feature=kp

The video is short and basically just says: Don’t tell someone they are racist; say that what they said sounds racist.

2. Probably the most useful thing we did related to this was a set of role-playing activities related to difficult classroom situations (e.g., one student responding to a role call asking for Lynda by saying ‘I would prefer to be called Justin and please use the pronoun he/him when referring to me’, followed by another student laughing in response to Justin’s request). I have to say that I’ve never been a big fan of role-playing (and am a terrible actor), but I found this set really useful in terms of thinking things through. Part of why it probably worked so well, though, was that everyone in the group had a lot of teaching experience. It might need to be tweaked for new instructors. I imagine CRLT would be able to help with this.

This is a great document by Meg Urry (Israel Munson Professor of Physics and Astronomy and the Director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics) with a survey of empirical evidence for gender bias and conformation to gender schema: http://www.equal.ethz.ch/news/women_in_science/summary_urry

and a general science summary: http://www.equal.ethz.ch/news/women_in_science

I also found this doc by the Anita Borg Institute: http://anitaborg.org/insights-tools/research/climbing-the-technical-ladder/

The document itself is worth less to me than the bibliography. Focusing more on industry brings in a new set of resources. I found the pieces by JD Yoder and TW McDonald on 'tokenism' (a term I don't love) and supporting women leaders in masculine-coded activities especially interesting.

For those of you on twitter, @Doctor_PMS is leading a journal club every (other?) Friday on diversity issues in STEM. This week’s topic was Planet Money’s story covering the steady decline in women in computer science since the 80’s:

http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding

The accompanying #DiversityJC hashtag is a good read. It has ideas and frustrations regarding how we can be inclusive with people who have never coded before. It’s a good fit for Software Carpentry teaching in general as well as our broader efforts to include everyone.
