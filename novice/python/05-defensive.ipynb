      "because if we knew what the output of the scientific code was supposed to be,\n",
      "we wouldn't be running the software:\n",
      "we'd be writing up our results and moving on to the next program.\n",
      "In practice,\n",
      "scientists tend to do the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. *Test with simplified data.*\n",
      " Before doing statistics on a real data set,\n",
      " we should try calculating statistics for a single record,\n",
      " for two identical records,\n",
      " for two records whose values are one step apart,\n",
      " or for some other case where we can calculate the right answer by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. *Test a simplified case.*\n",
      " If our program is supposed to simulate\n",
      " magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium,\n",
      " our first test should be a blob of helium that isn't rotating,\n",
      " and isn't being subjected to any external electromagnetic fields.\n",
      " Similarly,\n",
      " if we're looking at the effects of climate change on speciation,\n",
      " our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. *Compare to an oracle.*\n",
      " A [test oracle](../../gloss.html#test-oracle) is something&mdash;experimental data,\n",
      " an older program whose results are trusted,\n",
      " or even a human expert&mdash;against which we can compare the results of our new program.\n",
      " If we have a test oracle,\n",
      " we should store its output for particular cases\n",
      " so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like\n",
      " without re-running that program.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. *Check conservation laws.*\n",
      " Mass, energy, and other quantitites are conserved in physical systems,\n",
      " so they should be in programs as well.\n",
      " Similarly,\n",
      " if we are analyzing patient data,\n",
      " the number of records should either stay the same or decrease\n",
      " as we move from one analysis to the next\n",
      " (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values).\n",
      " If \"new\" patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline,\n",
      " it's probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. *Visualize.*\n",
      " Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both\n",
      " the science they're doing\n",
      " and the correctness of their code\n",
      " (just as we did in the [opening lesson](01-numpy.html) of this tutorial).\n",
      " This should only be used for debugging as a last resort,\n",
      " though,\n",
      " since it's very hard to compare two visualizations automatically.\n",

      "[makes it fail every time](../../rules.html#make-it-fail-every-time).\n",
      "The \"every time\" part is important because\n",
      "few things are more frustrating than debugging an intermittent problem:\n",
      "if we have to call a function a dozen times to get a single failure,\n",
      "the odds are good that we'll scroll past the failure when it actually occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this,\n",
      "it's always important to check that our code is \"plugged in\",\n",
      "i.e.,\n",
      "that we're actually exercising the problem that we think we are.\n",
      "Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug,\n",
      "only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong data set\n",
      "or with the wrong configuration parameters,\n",
      "or are using the wrong version of the software entirely.\n",
      "Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we're tired,\n",

      "and up against a deadline,\n",
      "which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions\n",
      "are almost never worthwhile.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Make It Fail Fast\n",
      "\n",
      "If it takes 20 minutes for the bug to surface,\n",
      "we can only do three experiments an hour.\n",
      "That doesn't must mean we'll get less data in more time:\n",
      "we're also more likely to be distracted by other things as we wait for our program to fail,\n",
      "which means the time we *are* spending on the problem is less focused.\n",
      "It's therefore critical to [make it fail fast](../../rules.html#make-it-fail-fast).\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as making the program fail fast in time,\n",
      "we want to make it fail fast in space,\n",
      "i.e.,\n",
      "we want to localize the failure to the smallest possible region of code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The smaller the gap between cause and effect,\n",
      " the easier the connection is to find.\n",
      " Many programmers therefore use a divide and conquer strategy to find bugs,\n",
      " i.e.,\n",
      " if the output of a function is wrong,\n",
      " they check whether things are OK in the middle,\n",
      " then concentrate on either the first or second half,\n",
