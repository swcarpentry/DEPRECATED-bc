title: Programming with MATLAB
---
The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to MATLAB is built around a common scientific task:
data analysis.
Our real goal isn't to teach you MATLAB,
but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on. We use 
MATLAB in our lessons because:

1. we have to use *something* for examples;
2. it's well-documented;
3. it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists in academia and the industry; and
4. it has a large library of packages available for performing diverse tasks.

But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, 
so that you can share you work with them easily, and to use that language *well*.
