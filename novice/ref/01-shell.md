#### Basic Commands

*   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
*   `cd path` changes the current working directory.
*   `cp old new` copies a file.
*   `find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.
*   `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
*   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
*   `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
*   `man command` displays the manual page for a given command.
*   `mkdir path` creates a new directory.
*   `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.
*   `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
*   `rm path` removes (deletes) a file.
*   `rmdir path` removes (deletes) an empty directory.
*   `sort` sorts its inputs.
*   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
*   `touch path` creates an empty file if it doesn't already exist.
*   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
*   `whoami` shows the user's current identity.

#### Paths

*   `/path/from/root` is an absolute path.
*   `/` on its own refers to the root of the filesystem.
*   `path/without/leading/slash` is a relative path.
*   `.` refers to the current directory, `..` to its parent.
*   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
*   `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.

#### Combining Commands

*   `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file.
*   `first | second` connects the output of the first command to the input of the second.
*   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list:

        for variable in name_1 name_2 name_3
        do
            ...commands refering to $variable...
        done

*   Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value).
*   `history` displays recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number.
*   `bash filename` runs commands saved in `filename`.
*   `$*` refers to all of a shell script's command-line parameters.
*   `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to specified command-line parameters.
*   `$(command)` inserts a command's output in place.
