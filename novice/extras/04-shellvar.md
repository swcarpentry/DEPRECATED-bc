# Shell Variables

The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables.
Those variables control its execution,
and by changing their values,
you can change how the shell and other programs behave.

Let's start by running the command `set` and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:

~~~
$ set
COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/home/vlad
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/gwilson/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/home/vlad
UID=1000
USERNAME=vlad
...
~~~

As you can see, there are quite a few&mdash;in fact, four or five times more than what's shown here.
And yes,
using `set` to *show* things might seem a little strange,
even for Unix,
but if you don't give it any arguments,
it might as well show you things you *could* set.

Every variable has a name.
By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names.
All shell variables' values are strings, even those (like `UID`) that look like numbers.
it's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
it would convert the value of the `NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` variable from a string to an integer.

Similarly, some variables (like `PATH`) store lists of values.
In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator.
If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
it's the program's responsibility to split the variable's string value into pieces.

Let's have a closer look at that `PATH` variable.
Its value defines the shell's [search path](../gloss.html#search-path),
i.e., the directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs.
If you recall, when we type a command like `./analyze` that has a specific directory in the path,
the shell runs the program that path specifies.
Similarly, if we type `/bin/analyze`, the shell runs that specific program:
we've provided a specific path, so it knows what to do.
But which one should the shell do if we just type `analyze`?

The rule is simple:
the shell checks each directory in the `PATH` variable in turn,
looking for a program with the requested name in that directory.
As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.

To show how this works, here are the components of `PATH` broken out one per line:

~~~
/Users/gwilson/bin
/usr/local/git/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
~~~

On our computer, there are actually three programs called `analyze` in three different directories:
`/bin/analyze`, `/usr/local/bin/analyze`, and `/users/vlad/analyze`.
Since the shell searches the directories in order, it finds the one in `/bin`, not either of the others.
Notice that it will *never* find the program `/users/vlad/analyze`,
since the directory `/users/vlad` isn't in our path.

Let's show the value of the variable `HOME`:

~~~
$ echo HOME
HOME
~~~

That just prints "HOME", which isn't what we wanted.
Let's try this instead: `echo $HOME`:

~~~
$ echo $HOME
/home/vlad
~~~

The dollar sign tells the shell to replace the variable's name with its value.
This works just like wildcards:
the shell does the replacement *before* running the program we've asked for.
Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is `echo /home/vlad`,
which displays the right thing.

Creating a variable is easy: just assign a value to a name using "=":

~~~
$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
Dracula
~~~

To change the value, just assign a new one:

~~~
$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY
Camilla
~~~

If we want to set some variables' values automatically every time we run a shell,
we can put the command to do this in a file called `.bashrc` in our home directory.
(The '.' character at the front prevents `ls` from listing this file
unless we specifically ask it to using `-a`:
we normally don't want to worry about it.
The "rc" at the end is an abbreviation for "run control",
which meant something really important decades ago,
and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)
For example, here are two lines in Vlad's `.bashrc` file,
which is in `/home/vlad/.bashrc`:

~~~
export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
~~~

These two lines create the variables `SECRET_IDENTITY` and `BACKUP_DIR`,
give them values,
and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
Notice that `BACKUP_DIR`'s definition relies on the value of `TEMP_DIR`,
so that if we change where we put temporary files,
our backups will be relocated automatically.

While we're here,
it's also common to use the `alias` command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
For example, we can define the alias `backup`
to run `/bin/zback` with a specific set of arguments:

~~~
alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
~~~

As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.
