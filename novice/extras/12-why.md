# Why I Teach

When I was your age, I thought universities existed to teach people
how to learn.  Later, when I was in grad school, I thought
universities were about doing research and creating new knowledge. Now
that I'm in my forties, though, I've realized that what we're really
doing here is teaching you how to take over the world&mdash;because
whether you like it or not, you're going to have to one day.

My parents are in their eighties now, and retired.  Their generation
doesn't run the world any more; instead, it's people my age, or a bit
older, who pass laws, decide whether interest rates will go up or
down, and make life-and-death decisions in hospitals.  As scary as it
seems, *we* are now the grownups.

Twenty years from now, though, we'll be heading for retirement, and
*you* will be in charge, because there won't be anyone else to do
it.  That may sound like a long time when you're nineteen, but let me
tell you, you take three breaths, and it's gone.  That's why we give
you problems whose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes.
That's why we put you in situations where you have to figure out what
needs to be done right now, what can be left for later, and what you
can simply ignore.  It's because if you don't start learning how to do
these things now, you won't be ready to do them on your own when you
have to.

Stirring stuff, isn't it? But it's not the whole answer.  I don't just
want my students to make the world a better place so that I can retire
in comfort.  I want them to make it a better place for everyone,
because I think that's the great adventure of our times. Forget about
landing on the moon and unraveling the genetic code: when future
historians write about our era, what they'll focus on is that for the
first time in history, our species started taking the Golden Rule
seriously.

Just think: a hundred and fifty years ago, most societies still
practiced slavery.  A hundred years ago, when my grandmother was a
young girl, she wasn't legally a person in Canada.  Fifty years ago,
most of the world's people suffered under totalitarian rule; in the
year I was born, African-Americans couldn't vote in Southern states,
and judges could and did order electroshock therapy to "cure"
homosexuals. Yes, there's still a lot wrong with the world, but look
at how many more choices you have than your grandparents did.  Look at
how many more things you can know, and be, and enjoy.  And most
importantly, look at how many other people can too.

This didn't happen by chance.  It happened because millions of us made
millions of little decisions, the sum of which was a better world.  We
usually don't think of these day-to-day decisions as being political,
but they are.  Every time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of
another, every time we choose to take this class instead of that one,
every time we *don't* give the homeless guy on the corner fifty cents,
every time we decide to shout an anatomical insult instead of a racial
one at a cabbie who shouldn't be allowed to drive a shopping cart,
we're putting our weight behind one vision of what the world should be
rather than another.  We don't think about this bigger picture most of
the time&mdash;we'd be paralyzed if we did.  But the last century and
a half shows that once enough people make "doing the right thing" a
habit, the big picture more or less takes care of itself.

In his 1947 essay "Why I Write", George Orwell said:

> In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive
> books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political
> loyalties.  As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of
> pamphleteer... Every line of serious work that I have written
> since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against
> totalitarianism... It seems to me nonsense, in a period like
> our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.
> Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a
> question of which side one takes and what approach one follows.

Replace "writing" with "teaching", and you'll have the real reason I
do this.  Every line of code you write changes the world in some small
way.  Every deadline you meet, every security hole you don't plug,
every user need you satisfy, every disability you don't
accommodate&mdash;each one makes tomorrow different from today.

I teach because I want you to be aware of that.  I want you to be
conscious of the fact that you're shaping the future we're all going
to spend the rest of our lives in.  I want you to do things right, and
to believe that doing things right is important, because the world
doesn't get better by chance, or on its own.  The world gets better
because people like you make it better: penny by penny, brick by
brick, vote by vote, and one line of code at a time.
