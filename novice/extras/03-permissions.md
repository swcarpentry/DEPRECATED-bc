# Permissions

It's now time to look at how Unix determines who can see the contents of which files,
who can *change* those files,
and who can run particular programs.
We will skip over many of the details,
as most people only need to know 10% of what Unix does
to accomplish every day-to-day task.
We will also defer discussion of Windows until the end of the section:
its concepts are similar,
but its rules are different,
and unfortunately there's no exact mapping between those rules and the ones Unix uses.
Let's start with Nelle.
She has a unique [user name](../gloss.html#user-name),
which is `nnemo`,
and a [user ID](../gloss.html#user-id),
which is 1404.

Users can belong to any number of [groups](../gloss.html#user-group),
each of which has a unique [group name](../gloss.html#user-group-name)
and numeric [group ID](../gloss.html#user-group-id).
The list of who's in what group is usually stored in the file `/etc/group`.
(If you're in front of a Unix machine right now,
try running `cat /etc/group` to look at that file.)

Now let's look at files and directories.
Along with each file's content,
the operating system stores the numeric IDs of the user and group that own it.
These values are *not* stored in the file itself,
but separately in space on the disk reserved for the operating system's use.

The user-and-group model means that
every user on the system falls into one of three categories:
the owner of the file,
someone else who is in the file's group,
and everyone else.
For each of these three categories,
the computer keeps track of
whether people in that category can read the file,
whether they can write to it,
and whether they can execute it
(i.e., run it if it is a program).
We can visualize all of this as a 3&times;3 table:

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>user</td><td>group</td><td>all</td></tr>
<tr><td>read</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>write</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>execute</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>no</td></tr>
</table>

Together, these permissions mean that:

*   the file's owner can read and write it, but not run it;
*   other people in the file's owning group can read it, but not modify it; and
*   nobody else can do anything with it at all.

Let's look at this model in action.
If we `cd` into the `labs` directory and run `ls -F`,
it puts a `*` at the end of `setup`'s name.
This is its way of telling us that `setup` is executable,
i.e.,
that it's (probably) something the computer can run.

~~~
$ cd labs
$ ls -F
safety.txt    setup*     waiver.txt
~~~

Now let's run the command `ls -l`:

~~~
$ ls -l
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio 31988  2010-07-23 20:04 setup
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt
~~~

The `-l` flag tells `ls` to give us a long-form listing.
It's a lot of information, so let's go through the columns in turn.

On the right side, we have the files' and directories' names.
Next to them,
moving left,
are the times they were last modified.
Backup systems and other tools use this information in a variety of ways that we'll explore in a later lecture,
but you can use it right away to tell which files are younger or older than which others.

Next to the modification time is the file's size in bytes.
Next to that is the ID of the group that owns it,
and of the user that owns it.
We'll skip over the second column for now,
because it's the column on the left that we care about most.
This shows the file's permissions, i.e., who can read, write, or execute it.

Let's have a closer look at one of those permission strings:
`-rwxr-xr-x`.
The first character tells us what type of thing this is.
'-' means it's a regular file, while 'd' means it's a directory.
The next three characters tell us what permissions the file's owner has.
Here, the owner can read, write, and execute the file.
The middle triplet shows us the group's permissions.
If the permission is turned off, we see a dash, so 'r-x' means "read and execute, but not write".
The final triplet shows us what everyone who isn't the file's owner, or in the file's group, can do.
In this case, it's 'r-x' again, so everyone on the system can look at the file's contents and run it.

So much for looking at permissions:
to change them, we use the `chmod` command.
(The name stands for "change mode",
which once again isn't particularly memorable.)
Here's a long-form listing showing the permissions on the final grades in the course Vlad is teaching:

~~~
$ ls -l final.grd
-rwxrwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-29 22:30 final.grd
~~~

Whoops: everyone in the world can read it.
And what's worse, modify it&mdash;crafty students could go in and change their grades.
(They could also try to run the grades file as a program,
which would almost certainly not work.)

The command to change the owner's permissions to 'rw-' is:

~~~
$ chmod u=rw final.grd
~~~

The 'u' signals that we're changing the privileges of the user (i.e., the file's owner),
and 'rw' is the new set of permissions.
A quick `ls -l` shows us that it worked,
because the owner's permissions are now set to read and write:

~~~
$ ls -l final.grd
-rw-rwxrwx 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd
~~~

Let's run `chmod` again to give the group read-only permission:

~~~
$ chmod g=r final.grd
$ ls -l final.grd
-rw-r--rw- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:19 final.grd
~~~

And finally,
let's give "all" (everyone on the system who isn't the file's owner or in its group) no permissions at all:

~~~
$ chmod a= final.grd
$ ls -l final.grd
-rw-r----- 1 vlad bio  4215  2010-08-30 08:20 final.grd
~~~

That's what "a=" means:
the 'a' signals that we're changing permissions for "all",
and since there's nothing on the right of the "=",
"all"'s new permissions are empty.

We can search by permissions, too.
Here, for example, we can use `-type&nbsp;f -perm&nbsp;-u=x` to find files
that the user can execute:

~~~
$ find . -type f -perm -u=x
./tools/format
./tools/stats
~~~

Before we go any further,
let's run `ls -a -l`
to get a long-form listing that includes directory entries that are normally hidden:

~~~
$ ls -a -l
drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio     0  2010-08-14 09:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio  8192  2010-08-27 23:11 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  1158  2010-07-11 08:22 safety.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vlad bio 31988  2010-07-23 20:04 setup
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vlad bio  2312  2010-07-11 08:23 waiver.txt
~~~

The permissions for `.` and `..` (this directory and its parent) start with a 'd'.
But look at the rest of their permissions:
the 'x' means that "execute" is turned on.
What does that mean?
A directory isn't a program&mdash;how can we "run" it?

In fact, 'x' means something different for directories.
It gives someone the right to *traverse* the directory, but not to look at its contents.
The distinction is subtle, so let's have a look at an example.
Vlad's home directory has three subdirectories called `venus`, `mars`, and `pluto`:

<img src="img/x-for-directories.svg" alt="Execute Permission for Directories" />

Each of these has a subdirectory in turn called `notes`,
and those sub-subdirectories contain various files.
If a user's permissions on `venus` are 'r-x',
then if she tries to see the contents of `venus` and `venus/notes` using `ls`,
the computer lets her see both.
If her permissions on `mars` are just 'r--',
then she is allowed to read the contents of both `mars` and `mars/notes`.
But if her permissions on `pluto` are only '--x',
she cannot see what's in the `pluto` directory:
`ls pluto` will tell her she doesn't have permission to view its contents.
If she tries to look in `pluto/notes`, though, the computer will let her do that.
She's allowed to go through `pluto`, but not to look at what's there.
This trick gives people a way to make some of their directories visible to the world as a whole
without opening up everything else.

Those are the basics of permissions on Unix.
As we said at the outset, though, things work differently on Windows.
There, permissions are defined by [access control list](../gloss.html#access-control-list),
or ACLs.
An ACL is a list of pairs, each of which combines a "who" with a "what".
For example,
you could give the Mummy permission to append data to a file without giving him permission to read or delete it,
and give Frankenstein permission to delete a file without being able to see what it contains.

This is more flexible that the Unix model,
but it's also more complex to administer and understand on small systems.
(If you have a large computer system,
*nothing* is easy to administer or understand.)
Some modern variants of Unix support ACLs as well as the older read-write-execute permissions,
but hardly anyone uses them.
