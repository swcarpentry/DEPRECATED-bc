title: Why I Teach
---
This is my daughter Madeline:

Several independent studies have confirmed that she is the cutest
child on the planet (plus or minus 5%, 19 times out of 20).  She means
the world to me, but by the time she's grown, the world is going to be
dealing with the consequences of our generation's short-sightedness.
Climate change, resource shortages, drug-resistant diseases&mdash;the
list is a long one, and the only things that will save us are more
science and more courage.

That's why I teach.  I teach because I need your help to make this
world fit for her to live in.  I teach because I need you to discover
more and invent faster so that the world she inherits from you will be
better than the one you're inheriting from my generation.  Science is
not just the greatest adventure of our time: it is, quite literally, a
matter of life and death, and I hope that what we have taught you will
help you do it better.

Thank you for your time: may you always see the world through the eyes
of a child.
