#### Objectives
*   Use `wc` to learn about a file's contents.
*   Learn what a bit is.
*   Learn what a byte is.
*   Use the output of one command as the command-line parameters to another command.

Sometimes you might be more interested in information `about` a file than in the actual contents of the file. Perhaps you just want to know how many lines it has. There is a handy command-line program called `wc` that can help you with this.


For our examples,
we will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a
1998 competition in *Salon* magazine. For this set of examples 
we're going to be working in the writing subdirectory:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd writing
$ cat haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
~~~
{:class="out"}


If we don't specify any parameters, 'wc' will tell us three things about the file:

-   line count
-   word count
-   byte count



~~~
$ wc haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
 12  38 212 haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="out"}


What are these three things?

A line is fairly straight forward idea. Two lines are separated by a "newline" character, written in most cases as `\n'.

Words are strings of characters separated by spaces.

Bytes are units of memory size. Most commonly they are units of 8 bits. Bits are the most basic unit of computer memory. Bits are binary, meaning they can have only one of two values -- in this case, one or zero.


Perhaps you don't really care about the bytes or the word count? Perhaps you only want to know the line count? If we give `wc` the `-l` flag, it restricts the output to the line count.

~~~
$ wc -l haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
12 haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="out"}

Likewise, you can use other flags to learn additional information about the file. Perhaps you want to know the length of the longest line in the file?

~~~
$ wc -L haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
28 haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="out"}


Or perhaps you don't currently care about the line count of the file, but you want to store the value for later?
If we just try to store the output using the `-l` flag, we get exactly what we would expect.


~~~
$ linecount=$(wc -l haiku.txt)
$ echo $linecount
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
12 haiku.txt
~~~
{:class="out"}


But we only want the number of the line count, not that extra word which might get in the way. Here's an easy way to fix that:


~~~
$ linecount=$(cat haiku.txt | wc -l)
$ echo $linecount
~~~
{:class="in"}
~~~
12
~~~
{:class="out"}
