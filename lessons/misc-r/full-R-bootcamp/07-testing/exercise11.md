# Testing exercise

1. Add tests for the functions you've created in this bootcamp.
2. create a folder called `inst/tests` in the package root
3. save tests into a single R script with the word `test` in the title or split them over multiple test. 
4. Group tests where necessary.
5. Run tests from the R prompt using `test_dir()` or `test_file()` from the `test_that` package.
6. Break your code and run the tests again. How do the tests behave now?
