      "To test functions and classes, the interfaces (API) - rather than the\n",

      "black box, we can probe the expected behavior with boundary cases for\n",
      "the inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**System Tests:** System level tests are intended to test the code as a\n",
      "whole. As opposed to unit tests, system tests ask for the behavior as a\n",
      "whole. This sort of testing involves comparison with other validated\n",
      "codes, analytical solutions, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Regression Tests:** A regression test ensures that new code does\n",

      "found and fixed.\n",
