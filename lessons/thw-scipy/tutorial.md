title: Using Scipy
---
**Based on Lecture Materials By Anthony Scopatz**

Scientific Python (SciPy) is a very robust package. It encompasses
several modules ranging from the eternally practical to the quirky and
cool. No matter what your discipline is, you can probably find a
pre-made short cut using SciPy. With its considerable scope, there is no
way we can cover all of its functionality in a single tutorial. That is
what documentation is for http://docs.scipy.org/doc/! However, we can talk about
the basics, show off some of its neater features, and generally teach the
'SciPy-way of doing things.'

The presentation on SciPy will follow five sections:

1.  SciPy Constants,
2.  Special Functions,
3.  Integration & ODEs,
4.  Pade Approximates,
5.  and Image Tricks.

In general, you can grab SciPy functionality via

```python
  import scipy 
```

What you get is (from
[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)):

```python
  -- Clustering package (**scipy.cluster**)
  -- Constants (**scipy.constants**)
  -- Fourier transforms (**scipy.fftpack**)
  -- Integration and ODEs (**scipy.integrate**)
  -- Interpolation (**scipy.interpolate**)
  -- Input and output (**scipy.io**)
  -- Linear algebra (**scipy.linalg**)
  -- Maximum entropy models (**scipy.maxentropy**)
  -- Miscellaneous routines (**scipy.misc**)
  -- Multi-dimensional image processing (**scipy.ndimage**)
  -- Orthogonal distance regression (**scipy.odr**)
  -- Optimization and root finding (**scipy.optimize**)
  -- Signal processing (**scipy.signal**)
  -- Sparse matrices (**scipy.sparse**)
  -- Sparse linear algebra (**scipy.sparse.linalg**)
  -- Spatial algorithms and data structures (**scipy.spatial**)
  -- Special functions (**scipy.special**)
  -- Statistical functions (**scipy.stats**)
  -- Image Array Manipulation and Convolution (**scipy.stsci**)
  -- C/C++ integration (**scipy.weave**)
```

SciPy Constants, crawl before you walk!
=======================================

A plethora of important, fundamental constants can be found in
**scipy.constants**. NOTE: However, this module is not automatically
included when you **import scipy**. Still, some very basic pieces of
information are given as module attributes.

The following, for example:

```python
  import scipy.constants 
  import math
  
  print("SciPy thinks that pi = %.16f"%scipy.constants.pi) 
  print("While math thinks that pi = %.16f"%math.pi) 
  print("SciPy also thinks that the speed of light is c = %.1F"%scipy.constants.c) 
```

will return

```python
  >>> SciPy thinks that pi = 3.1415926535897931 
  >>> While math thinks that pi = 3.1415926535897931 
  >>> SciPy also thinks that the speed of light is c = 299792458.0 
```

However, the real value of SciPy Constants is its enormous physical
constant database. These are of the form:
**scipy.constants.physical\_constants[name] = (value, units,
uncertainty)**.

For example, the mass of an alpha particle is:

```python

  >>> scipy.constants.physical_constants["alpha particle mass"] 
  >>> (6.6446564999999997e-27, 'kg', 1.1e-33) 
```

How can you tell what the key is for this function? My favorite way is
with the scipy.constants.find() method.

```python
  scipy.constants.find("light")
```

gives :

```python
  ['speed of light in vacuum']
```

But buyer beware! Let's look at the speed of light again.

```python
  >>> print("c = %s"%str(scipy.constants.physical_constants["speed of light in vacuum"]))
  >>> c = (299792458.0, 'm s^-1', 0.0)
```

The uncertainty in c should not be zero! Right? Wrong. The
[meter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre) is in fact set by the speed of light
in a vacuum. So there is, by definition, no error. However, this has not always
been the case.  Moreover, any actual determination of the **c** or the meter has
a measurement uncertainty, but SciPy does not acknowledge it.

**BASIC LESSON:** As always, pay attention.

Check http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html for a complete
constants listing.

The above code is reproduced concisely in the constants.py file found in
the SciPy directory of your PyTrieste repository.

SciPy Special Functions, walk before you run!
=============================================

Code that numerically approximates common (and some not-so-common)
special functions can be found in **scipy.special**. Here you can find
things like error functions, gamma functions, Legendre polynomials, etc.
But as a example let's focus on my favorites: the Bessel functions.

```python
  from scipy.special import * 
  from pylab import *
  
  x = arange(0.0, 10.1, 0.1)
  
  for n in range(4): 
    j = jn(n, x) 
    plot(x, j, 'k-') 
    text(x[10*(n+1)+1], j[10*(n+1)], r'$J_%r$'%n)
  
  for n in range(3): 
    y = yn(n, x) plot(x, y, 'k--') 
    text(x[10*(n)+6], y[10*(n)+5], r'$Y_%r$'%n)
  
  axis([0, 10, -2, 1.25]) 
  xlabel(r'$x$') 
  ylabel("Bessel Functions")
  
  show() 
```

These 20-ish lines of code should produce :

6.5.1 in ''Numerical Recipes'' by W. H. Press, et al...
(http://www.nr.com/).

Check out http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/special.html for a complete
listing of special functions.

The above code is reproduced concisely in special\_functions.py which
can be found in the SciPy directory of your PyTrieste repository.

SciPy Integration, run before you glide!
========================================

Tools used to calculate numerical, definite integrals may be found in
the **integrate** module. There are two basic ways you can integrate in
SciPy:

1.  Integrate a function,
2.  Integrate piecewise data.

First, let's deal with integration of functions. Recall that in Python,
functions are also objects. Therefore you can pass functions as
arguments to other functions! Just make sure that the function that you
want to integrate returns a float, or at the very least, an object that
has a **__float__()** method.

Integration Example: 1D
-----------------------

The simplest way to compute a functions definite integral is via the
**quad(...)** function. The script

```python
  import scipy.integrate #For kicks, let's also grab
  import scipy.special
  import numpy
  def CrazyFunc(x):
    return (scipy.special.i1(x) - 1)**3

  print("Try integrating CrazyFunc on the range [-5, 10]...")
  
  val, err = scipy.integrate.quad(CrazyFunc, -5, 10)

  print("A Crazy Function integrates to %.8E"%val)
  print("And with insanely low error of %.8E"%err)
```

will return


```python
  >>> Try integrating CrazyFunc on the range [-5, 10]...  
  >>> A Crazy Function integrates to 6.65625226E+09 
  >>> And with insanely low error of 3.21172897E-03
```

Integration Example: Infinite Limits
------------------------------------

You can also use **scipy.integrate.Inf** for infinity in the limits of
integration. For example, try integrating e\^x on `[-inf, 0]`:

```python
  >>> print("(val, err) = " + 
      str( scipy.integrate.quad(scipy.exp, -scipy.integrate.Inf, 0.0) ))
```

will return :

```python
  >>> (val, err) = (1.0000000000000002, 5.8426067429060041e-11)
```

Integration Example: 2D
-----------------------

Two dimensional integrations follow similarly to the 1D case. However,
now we need to use the **dblquad( f(y,x), ...)** function instead of
simply **quad( f(x), ...)**. Because a picture is worth 10\^3 words,
SciPy computes the right-hand side of the following equation:

![](/images/dblquad.png)

More information on the justification of this integral may be found at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order\_of\_integration\_(calculus). For
example, let's try to integrate the surface area of a unit sphere:

```python
  def dA_Sphere(phi, theta):
    return  scipy.sin(phi)

  print("Integrate the surface area of the unit sphere...")
  val, err = scipy.integrate.dblquad(dA_Sphere, 0.0, 2.0*scipy.pi, 
    lambda theta: 0.0, 
    lambda theta: scipy.pi )
  print("val = %.8F"%val)
  print("err = %.8E"%err)
```

This will return :

```python
  >>> Integrate the surface area of the unit sphere...  
  >>> val = 12.56637061
  >>> err = 1.39514740E-13
```

There are a couple of subtleties here. First is that the function you
are integrating over is defined as **f(y,x)** and NOT the more standard
**f(x,y)**. Moreover, while **x**'s limits of integration are given
directly **[0, 2*pi]**,**y**'s limits have to be functions**[g(x),
h(x)]*\* (given by the 'lambdas' here). This method of doing double
integrals allows for**y*\* to have a more complicated edge in**x*\* than
a simple point. This is great for some functions but a little annoying
for simple integrations. In any event, the above integral computes the
surface are of a unit sphere to be **4*pi*\* to within floating point
error.

Integration Example: 3D
-----------------------

Three dimensional integration is more similar to 2D than 1D. Once again,
we define our function variables in reverse order, **f(z, y, x)**, and
integrate using **tplquad( f(z, y, x) )**. Moreover, **z** has limits of
integration defined by surfaces give as functions **[q(x,y), r(x,y)]**.
Thus, **tplquad(...)** integrates the right-hand side of :

![](/images/trplquad.png)

To continue with the previous example, let's try integrating the volume
of a sphere. Take the radius here to be 3.5.

```python
  def dV_Sphere(phi, theta, r):
    return r * r * dA_Sphere(phi, theta)

  print("Integrate the volume of a sphere with r=3.5...")
  val, err = scipy.integrate.tplquad(dV_Sphere, 0.0, 3.5, lambda r: 0.0,
    lambda r: 2.0*scipy.pi, lambda x, y: 0.0, lambda x, y: scipy.pi)
  print("val = %.8F"%val)
  print("err = %.8E"%err)
```

will return:

```python
  >>> Integrate the volume of a sphere with r=3.5...
  >>> val = 179.59438003
  >>> err = 1.99389816E-12
```

A simple hand calculation verifies this result.

Integration Example: Trapazoidal
--------------------------------

Now, only very rarely will scientists (and even more rarely engineers)
will truely 'know' the function that they wish to integrate. Much more
often we'll have piecewise data that we wish numerically integrate (ie
sum an array y(x), biased by array x). This can be done in SciPy through
the **trapz(...)** function.

```python
  y = range(0, 11)
  print("Trapazoidally integrate y = x on [0,10]...")
  val = scipy.integrate.trapz(y)
  print("val = %F"%val)
```

will return:

```python
  >>> Trapazoidally integrate y = x on [0,10]...
  >>> val = 50.000000
```

The above takes a series of y-values that are implicitly spaced 1-unit
apart in x and 'trapazoidally integrates' them. Basically, just a sum.

However, you can use the **x= [0, 3,...]** or **dx = 3** argument
keywords to explicitly declare different spacings in x. For example,
with y = x\^2:

```python
  x = numpy.arange(0.0, 20.5, 0.5)
  y = x * x
  print("Trapazoidally integrate y = x^2 on [0,20] with half steps...")
  val = scipy.integrate.trapz(y, x)
  print("val = %F"%val)
```

```python
  >>> Trapazoidally integrate y = x^2 on [0,20] with half steps...
  >>> val = 2667.500000
```

```python
  print("Trapazoidally integrate y = x^2 with dx = 0.5...")
  val = scipy.integrate.trapz(y, dx = 0.5)
  print("val = %F"%val)
```

```python
  >>> Trapazoidally integrate y = x^2 with dx = 0.5...
  >>> val = 2667.500000
```

Integration Example: Ordinary Differential Equations
----------------------------------------------------

Say that you have an ODE of the form **dy/dt = f(y, t)** that you
''really'' need integrated. Then you, my friend, are in luck! SciPy can
do this for you using the **scipy.integrate.odeint** function. This is
of the form:

```python
  odeint( f, y0, [t0, t1, ...])
```

For example take the decay equation:
   (y, t) = - lambda * y 

We can then try integrating this using a decay constant of 0.2`:

```python
  def dDecay(y, t, lam):
    return -lam*y

  vals = scipy.integrate.odeint( lambda y, t: dDecay(y, t, 0.2), 1.0, [0.0, 10.0] )
  print("If you start with a mass of y(0) = %F"%vals[0][0])
  print("you'll only have y(t= 10) = %F left."%vals[1][0])
```

This will return

```python
  >>> If you start with a mass of y(0) = 1.000000
  >>> you'll only have y(t= 10) = 0.135335 left.
```

Check out http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html for more
information on integreation.

The above code is reproduced concisely in integrate.py, which can be
found in the SciPy direcotry of your PyTreiste repository.

SciPy Pade, glide before you fly!
=================================

As you have seen, SciPy has some really neat functionality that comes
stock. Oddly, some of the best stuff is in the ```miscellaneous``` module
accessed via **import scipy.misc**. What follows is a brief explanation of the
Pade Approximant (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padé\_approximant) and how to
utilize it in SciPy.

Most people are familar with the polynomial expansions of a function:

    f(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + ...

Or a Taylor expansion:

    f(x) = sum( d^n f(a) / dx^n (x-a)^n /n! )

However, there exists the lesser known, more exact Pade approximation.
This basically splits up a function into a numerator and a denominator.

    f(x) = p(x) / q(x)

Then, you can approximate p(x) and q(x) using a power series. However to
generate p(x) and q(x) of order ```N```, you first need the
polynomial approximation of f(x) to order ```2N+1``` (for when p and
q are expanded to the same order). Thus the Pade approximate is a way to
squeeze greater orders of accuracy out of another, more expensively
gained approximation. A more complete treatment is available in Section
5.12 in ''Numerical Recipes'' by W. H. Press, et al...
(http://www.nr.com/). The strength of this method
is demonstrated though examples and figures.

First let's take the case for where f(x) = e\^x.

```python
  import scipy.misc
  from pylab import *
  
  #Let's expand e^x to fifth order and record the coefficents 
  e_exp = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0/2.0, 1.0/6.0, 1.0/24.0, 1.0/120.0]
  
  #The Pade coefficients are given simply by, 
  p, q = scipy.misc.pade(e_exp, 2)
  #p and q are of numpy's polynomial class
  #So the Pade approximation is given by 
  def PadeAppx(x):
      return p(x) / q(x)
  
  #Let's test it...
  x = arange(0.0, 3.1, 0.1)
  
  e_exp.reverse()
  e_poly = poly1d(e_exp)
  
  plot(x, PadeAppx(x), 'k--', label="Pade Approximation")
  plot(x, scipy.e**x, 'k-', label=r'$e^x$')
  plot(x, e_poly(x), 'r-', label="Power Series")
  
  xlabel(r'$x$')
  ylabel("Exponential Functions")
  
  legend(loc=0)

  show()
```

The above script, pade1.py, generates the following figure :

![](/images/PadeFigure1.png)

Now the gains from using the Pade approximant for an exponential here seem
slight. This is because the original exponential expansion is rather well
defined. Still the Pade version in this case has two important advantages:

 1. The power series version of e\^x would still require about twice as many
    terms to gain that slight increase in accuracy that the Pade gives.

 2. If instead x were replaced by the matrix A, then e\^A could be calculated
    with about half as many multiplications and sums using Pade rather than a
    polynomial. Success!

However, Pade's real power can be seen when approximating a different
function. Let's try approximating a rougher function...

```python

  import scipy.misc
  from pylab import *
  
  def f(x):
          return (7.0 + (1+x)**(4.0/3.0))**(1.0/3.0)
  
  #Through someone else's labors we know the expansion to be... 
  f_exp = [2.0, 1.0/9.0, 1.0/81.0, -49.0/8748.0, 175.0/78732.0]
  
  #The Pade coefficients are given simply by, 
  p, q = scipy.misc.pade(f_exp, (5-1)/2)
  #p and q are of numpy's polynomial class
  #So the Pade approximation is given by 
  def PadeAppx(x):
          return p(x) / q(x)
  
  #Let's test it...
  x = arange(0.0, 10.01, 0.01)
  
  f_exp.reverse()
  f_poly = poly1d(f_exp)
  
  plot(x, PadeAppx(x), 'k--', label="Pade Approximation")
  plot(x, f(x), 'k-', label=r'$f(x)$')
  plot(x, f_poly(x), 'r-', label="Power Series")
  
  xlabel(r'$x$')
  ylabel("Polynomial Function")

  legend(loc=0)

  show()
```

The above script, pade2.py, generates the following figure
![](/images/PadeFigure2.png)

Note, that this example is again taken from Section 5.12 in Numerical
Recipes by W. H. Press, et
al (http://www.nr.com/).

for more details on SciPy's Pade interface.

SciPy Image Tricks, fly before you....You can do that?!
=======================================================

For some reason that has yet to be explained to me, SciPy has the
ability to treat 2D & 3D arrays as images. You can even convert PIL
images or read in external files as numpy arrays! From here, you can
fool around with the raw image data at will. Naturally, this
functionality is buried (again) within the ```miscellaneous``` module.

First let's read in an image file. For now make it a JPEG. From
Wikipedia. Of a bunny.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JumpingRabbit.JPG

![](/images/image.jpg)

```python
  import scipy.misc
  img = scipy.misc.imread("image.jpg")
  #Note that this really is an array!
  print(str(img))
```

```python

  >>> [[[130 174  27]
  >>>   [129 173  24]
  >>>   [127 171  22]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [147 192  41]
  >>>   [146 190  41]
  >>>   [146 190  41]]
  >>> 
  >>>  [[137 177  29]
  
  >>>   [133 175  27]
  >>>   [130 173  21]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [147 192  37]
  >>>   [149 194  41]
  >>>   [149 194  41]]
  >>> 
  >>>  [[141 177  29]
  >>>   [137 176  25]
  >>>   [130 174  19]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [148 194  34]
  >>>   [149 195  35]
  >>>   [149 195  35]]
  >>> 
  >>>  ..., 
  >>>  [[ 77 126   1]
  >>>   [ 87 137  14]
  >>>   [ 85 139   0]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [ 77 128   0]
  >>>   [ 99 159   3]
  >>>   [128 183  17]]
  
  >>>  [[ 86 139   0]
  >>>   [ 90 141  12]
  >>>   [ 82 136   0]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [ 66 114   2]
  >>>   [102 160   0]
  >>>   [119 174  11]]
  >>> 
  >>>  [[ 89 140   0]
  >>>   [ 79 129   8]
  >>>   [ 87 139   2]
  >>>   ..., 
  >>>   [ 67 117   4]
  >>>   [ 81 138   0]
  >>>   [117 172  18]]]
```

We can now apply some basic filters...

```python
  img = scipy.misc.imfilter(img, 'blur')
```

We can even rotate the image, counter-clockwise by degrees.

```python
  img = scipy.misc.imrotate(img, 45)
```

And then, we can rewrite the array to an image file.

```python
  scipy.misc.imsave("image1.jpg", img)
```

These functions produce the following image:

![](/images/image1.jpg)

Because the array takes integer values from 0 - 255, we can easily
define our own filters as well! For instance, you could write a two-line
function to inverse the image...

```python
  def InverseImage(imgarr):
     return 255 - imgarr
  #Starting fresh we get...
  img = scipy.misc.imread("image.jpg")
  img = scipy.misc.imrotate(img, 330)
  img = InverseImage(img)
  scipy.misc.imsave("image2.jpg", img)
```

Having this much fun, the rabbit becomes a twisted shade of its former
self!

listing of associated image functions.

directory of your repository..
