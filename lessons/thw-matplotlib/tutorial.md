Plotting in Python
==================

Do this while I talk. If this is your first use of matplotlib (ever on
this machine), it will take a little longer starting up.

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot 
```

The ability to visually represent data is one of the more important
tools to the scientific user of python. The most popular and arguably
most mature library for producing publication quality 2D plots
matplotlib (MatPlotLib). In the developers own words, MatPlotLib is

> a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality
> figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments
> across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python
> and ipython shell (ala MatLab or mathematica), web application
> servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits."

pyplot, pylab and matplotlib. numpy, MatLab and more...
-------------------------------------------------------

The underlying structure of MatPlotLib is very general and customizable.
Thankfully, you don't actually need to interact with all that power. The
way to generate plots and modify them is through the pyplot interface.
The pyplot interface is much much inspired by Matlab's plotting
commands, so it should if you're familiar with that it should be easy to
pick up.

-   matplotlib - raw access to the plotting library. useful for
    extending matplotlib or doing very custom things
-   pyplot - MatLab-like interface to matplotlib (use this one!)
-   pylab - pyplot + numpy

**Aside: Multiple Interfaces to MatPlotLib**

In addition to the object oriented pyplot interface, pyplot implements a
clone of Matlab's plotting interface. The main difference is that the
Matlab interface has the paradigm of the "current figure." So plotting
and labeling commands implicitly refer to the current figure/subplot.
This is fine so long as your plotting commands are simple and
sequential. However, when your program requires that you modify a figure
in multiple contexts the Matlab interface becomes very difficult to keep
up with.

In this session, we will use the object oriented interface exclusively.
It is trivial to degrade to the Matlab interface if you're feeling lazy,
but the object oriented interface is powerful. It is also more explicit.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
```

First things first. Let's plot something. Open up a file, copy, paste,
execute.

```python
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  x = range(0,10)
  y = [val**2 for val in x]
  ax = plt.subplot(111)
  ax.plot(x,y)
  plt.show()
```

figures, subplots, and axes
---------------------------

MatPlotLib plots are organized into figures, subplots and axes.

![](/python/scipy/images/fig1.jpg)

-   figure = the whole window (Figure 1 above)
-   subplot = the regular grid of four plots (One, Two, Three, and Four
    above) within the window
-   axes = a handle to the place in the subplot to put your curves
    (there are four axes defining the locations of the 6 curves above.)

### Hands On Exercise : Making a Plot

Lets make a plot. Retyping everything is not fun. Open up your favorite
text editor to create a file "plot.py" to hold your plotting script.

0.  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

1.  Make a figure: **fig = plt.figure()**

2.  Add a subplot to the figure: **ax = fig.add\_subplot(111)**

3.  Plot on the subplot axes: **ax.plot(range(10))**

4.  Show the figure: **plt.show()**

    Your file should look like :

    ```python
      from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
      fig = plt.figure()
      ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
      ax.plot([1,2,3,4,5,6])
    ```

5.  Run your python file from the terminal **python plot.py &**

Customizing your Figure
-----------------------

Other, sometimes more convenient ways to get axes.

```python

  # Useful for figures composed of multiple subplots
  fig = plt.figure()
  ax1 = fig.add_subplot(221)
  ax2 = fig.add_subplot(222)
  ax3 = fig.add_subplot(223)
  ax4 = fig.add_subplot(224)
  
  # Useful for figures with one subplot (ie the subplot is the figure)
  ax2 = subplot(111)
  
  # Useful for overlaying axes, sharing the x axis
  ax3 = plt.twinx(ax2)
```


### Customizing your Plot

Plot is pretty powerful, lets peruse the [MatPlotLib
documentation](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net).

1.  By editing plot.py and referencing the documentation try to add a
    label to an axis or change the color.
2.  If you're feeling adventurous and you've successfully added a label,
    try ax.legend()

Hints:

-   legend
-   colors
-   linestyles
-   kwargs !

Other Types of Line Plots
=========================

MatPlotLib as all the usual types of plots

log-linear, linear-log, log-log
-------------------------------

```python

  ax.semilogx(x,y)
  ax.semilogy(x,y)
  ax.loglog(x,y)
```

Execute ax.semilogx(range(1,11),range(10)) within your script instead of
ax.plot(x) and run it again to see the effect.

Contour plots and pcolor
------------------------

Notice that for the z argument to pcolor is shorter by one in both
directions. You should think of z as being defined zone centered. If you
forget to do so, it will drop the last row and column.

```python
  
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  
  r = np.linspace(0.1,2,200)
  t = np.linspace(np.pi/4,7*np.pi/4,200)
  r,t = np.meshgrid(r,t)
  x = r*np.cos(t)
  y = r*np.sin(t)
  z = (x+0.6)**2 + (y-1.)**2
  
  ax = plt.subplot(111)
  
  ax.pcolor(x,y,z[1:,1:])
  # ax.colorbar()
  
  con = ax.contour(x,y,z)
  ax.clabel(con)

  plt.show()
```

Random useful things
====================

Spy
---

Matlab converts may have used this function to look at the structure of sparse
[matrixes](http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/matrixes).

```python

  n = 20
  f = diag(ones(n)) + diag(ones(n-1),1) + diag(ones(n-3),-3)
  spy(f)
```

Masked Arrays
-------------

Masked arrays are numpy ndarrays that have a mask to hide elements of
the ndarray. They are really handy to use when plotting and you just
want to make particular parts of the plot "go away." In theory you could
modify the underlying arrays to do the right thing, but that's a lot of
work. You shouldn't have to do it if you don't have to. Masked arrays are
the answer. For more detailed information, check out the [masked arrray
documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/maskedarray.html)
] and [constructing masked
arrays](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/maskedarray.generic.html#constructing-masked-arrays).

Starting from the pcolor plot, add the following code after defining z and
before plotting things.

```python
  z = np.ma.masked_where( np.abs(y-x) < 0.2, z )
```

draw() vs show()
----------------

If you're changing plots after they render (ie show()) you have to tell
MatPlotLib to draw the plot. draw() forces a figure to redraw. If you're
doing all your plotting from scripts, you probably won't have to deal
with draw(). If you're programming figures such that they change over
the course of your program, you will need to use draw to refresh the
figure.

How do I make a plot like ... ?
===============================

MatPlotLib has an extensive
[gallery](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html) of plots with
source code. Take a look through those; they probably have something
similar to what you want to do. If you click on one of these images, you'll
land on a page with the source that created it. Recently, I've noticed that
the server has been throttling my traffic. If you see one you like but get
a "Too many requests warning" go to the matplotlib github repository
(https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/examples/pylab_examples)
and look for the source code there.

My favorite, among these, is
[polar_bar.py](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/tree/master/examples/pylab_examples/polar_bar.py).

Choose your own adventure
=========================

-   keyboard/mouse bindings (interactive plots!)
-   [image
    plotting](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/image_tutorial.html)
-   Shared Axes Across Subplots

Event binding with MatPlotLib
=============================

MatPlotLib has a built in mechanism for handling keyboard/mouse events
in a platform independent way. This can be useful when you want to
toggle different data on and off in the same figure, or step through
time dependent data, or something else crazy that you dream up. All you
need a a function that draws the figure and some logic to identify
events that your care about. MatPlotLib handles the rest. Lets walk
through the following code.

-   A MovingPlot instance remembers which plot and axes to modify (no
    current figure nonsense!)
-   In the constructor, we draw() the initial frame
-   The attribute cid listens for "key press events" and calls
    self.update(event) when something happens
-   event is a 'key\_press\_event' object, with attributes like "key"
-   update() takes one argument: an event object (other than the
    unavoidable self)
-   Based on the event object passed, update() only does something on
    right and left arrow key presses
-   MatPlotLib has several other [supported events](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/backend_bases_api.html?highlight=canvas#matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect)

```python

  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  
  class MovingPlot(object):
  """ MovingPlot plots a figure that flows across the screen.  Right and left 
  arrows move the figure one step"""
      def __init__(self, r0= [-0.8, 1.0], v0 = [0.1, 0.]):
          # set up grid
          r = np.linspace(0.2,2,20)
          t = np.linspace(np.pi/4, 7*np.pi/4, 20)
          r,t = np.meshgrid(r,t)
          self.x = r*np.cos(t)
          self.y = r*np.sin(t)
  
          self.x0 = r0[0]
          self.y0 = r0[1]
          self.vx = v0[0]
          self.vy = v0[1]
  
          # create figure and axes for reuse
          self.fig = plt.figure()
          self.ax = self.fig.add_subplot(111)
  
          # draw the initial frame
          self.frame = 0
          self.draw(self.frame)
  
          # call self.update everytime a 'key_press_event' happens
          # bind this behavior to an object so it persists
          self.cid = self.fig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', self.update)
          plt.show()
  
      def update(self, event):
          """Changes the frame number based on event and draws a new frame if the 
          frame changed"""
          if event.key ==  'right':
              print 'forward'
              self.frame += 1
          elif event.key == 'left':
              print 'backward'
              self.frame -= 1
          else:
              return
          self.draw(self.frame)
  
      def draw(self, t):
          """Draws the frame occuring at time=t"""
          x = self.x - self.vx*t
          y = self.y - self.vy*t
          z = (x-self.x0)**2 + (y-self.y0)**2
          self.ax.pcolor(self.x, self.y, z)
          self.fig.canvas.draw()
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      mplot = MovingPlot()
```

Image Manipulation
==================

MatPlotLib has the ability to plot images. Check out the following code.
It plots 4 subplots

-   an image of a bunny
-   an image of a bunny with stuff over plotted
-   an image of a generated array
-   a pcolor plot of the same data

```python
    
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import urllib
  
  # read png into img
  try:
      img = plt.imread('bunny.png')
  except RuntimeError:
      print "can't find bunny.png, trying to download"
      # the image probably doesn't exits
      url = 
      'http://github.com/thehackerwithin/PyTrieste.wiki/images/bunny.png'
      urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename='bunny.png')
      img = plt.imread('bunny.png')
  
  fig = plt.figure()
  
  # plot just the bunny
  ax = fig.add_subplot(221)
  ax.imshow(img)
  ax.set_title('just the bunny')
  
  # plot bunny with stuff on top
  ax = fig.add_subplot(223)
  ax.imshow(img)
  xmin,xmax = ax.get_xlim() # plot changes the plotting limits
  ymin,ymax = ax.get_ylim() # snag them here for future uses
  x = np.linspace(100, 700, 10)
  y = np.sin(x/100)*300 + 300
  ax.plot(x,y)
  ax.set_xlim(xmin,xmax) # reset the limits to what imshow would have them be
  ax.set_ylim(ymin,ymax)
  ax.set_title('bunny with overlaid plots')
  
  # plot an array of doubles
  ax = fig.add_subplot(222)
  x = np.linspace(0,200, 10)
  y = np.linspace(0,200, 10)
  x,y = np.meshgrid(x,y)
  z = np.sin(x/200. * 2*np.pi) * np.sin(y/200. * 2*np.pi) * x/200 * y/200
  image = ax.imshow(z)
  plt.colorbar(image)
  ax.set_title('imshow() of array')
  
  # plot pcolor of z
  ax = fig.add_subplot(224)
  image = ax.pcolor(z)
  plt.colorbar(image)
  ax.set_title('pcolor() of same array array')
  
  plt.show()
```

Shared Axes Across Subplots
===========================

Take a look at the following plotting script. It plots 4 subplots. If
the bottom left subplot is the anchor, 1 subplot shares the xaxis (top
left). 1 subplot shares the yaxis (bottom right). 1 subplot shares both
axes (top right).

```python
  
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  
  t = np.arange(0.01, 5.0, 0.01)
  s1 = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
  s2 = np.exp(-t)
  s3 = np.sin(4*np.pi*t)
  
  fig = plt.figure()
  ax1 = fig.add_subplot(223)
  ax1.plot(t,s1)
  ax1.axvline(2, color='k', lw=3)
  ax1.axhline(0, color='r', lw=3)
  
  ## share x only
  ax2= fig.add_subplot(221, sharex
  ax1)
  ax2.plot(t, s2)
  ax2.axvline(2, color='k', lw=3)
  ax2.axhline(0, color='r', lw= 3)
  # make x tick labels invisible
  plt.setp( ax2.get_xticklabels(), visible=False)
  
  ## share x and y
  ax3 = fig.add_subplot(222,  sharex= ax1, sharey=ax1)
  ax3.plot(t, s3)
  ax3.axvline(2, color='k', lw=3)
  ax3.axhline(0, color= 'r', lw=3)
  ax3.set_xlim(0.01,5.0)
  # make tick labels small
  plt.setp( ax3.get_xticklabels(), fontsize=6)
  plt.setp( ax3.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=6)
  
  ## share y only
  ax4 = fig.add=subplot(224, sharey = ax1)
  ax4.plot(t, s3)
  ax4.axvline(2, color= 'k', lw = 3)
  ax4.axhline(0, color= 'r', lw = 3)
  # make y tick labels invisible
  plt.setp( ax4.get_yticklabels(), visible=False)
  
  plt.show()
```
