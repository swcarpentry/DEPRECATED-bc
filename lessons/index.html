    <dt><a href="swc-shell/tutorial.html">The Unix Shell</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Core material for the Unix shell:
      the organization of files and directories,
      creating and deleting things,
      the pipe and filter model,
      processing multiple files using loops,
      putting commonly-used commands in shell scripts,
      and finding things.
      <br/>
      To do: diagrams.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="swc-git/tutorial.html">Version Control with Git</a></dt>
    <dd>
      A short introduction to version control using Git and GitHub
      that builds toward a branch-per-feature workflow.
      <br/>
      To do: lots of revision; diagrams.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="swc-python/tutorial.html">Basic Programming Using Python</a></dt>
    <dd>
      An introduction to basic programming concepts using the IPython Notebook, skimage.novice, and ipythonblocks.

      To do: lots.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="swc-setdict/tutorial.html">Sets and Dictionaries</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Optional material for Python programming:
      sets and dictionaries,
      how hash-based data structures work,
      the JSON data format
      (which relies heavily on dictionaries),
      and three examples of increasing complexity.
      <br/>
      To do: diagrams.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="swc-invperc/tutorial.html">Invasion Percolation</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Invasion percolation is a good half-day example
      that brings together many of the things we teach about programming
      while introducing new concepts like performance profiling and development lifecycles.
      <br/>
      To do: diagrams; challenges; IPython Notebooks.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="swc-db/tutorial.html">Databases and SQL</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Core material for SQL databases:
      selection,
      removing duplicates,
      filtering with Boolean conditions,
      performing calculations on values,
      sorting,
      handling NULLs,
      aggregating values,
      grouping,
      joining multiple tables,
      a <em>very</em> brief introduction to creating tables and inserting data,
      an equally brief coverage of transactions,
      and a couple of examples showing how to uses databases from inside a program.
      <br/>
      To do: diagrams, and material on how to design and structure tables.

      a little bit of history,
      basic HTML,
      using a templating engine to create pages,
      how HTTP works,
      fetching data programmatically,
      providing data by dynamically generating static pages,
      why and how to create an index,
      and data syndication.
      <br/>
      To do: diagrams; switch from Jinja2 to Jekyll (since that's what GitHub uses).
