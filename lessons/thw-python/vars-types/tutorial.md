title: The Basics of Python

**Based on materials by: Milad Fatenejad, Katy Huff, Tommy Guy, Joshua R. Smith, Will Trimble, and many more**

## Introduction

This lecture is on basic programming in python. In order to do the
examples, we are going to use an environment called IPython notebook.
I expect this lecture to be interactive, so stop me at any point if
you have questions. The correct power dynamic is that people are the
masters and the machines are servants. The computer is a hammer; it
exists to help us get things done.  We can hammer nails with the
handle, with the claw of the hammer; some of us even hammer nails with
bricks.  But when you learn what part of the hammer works best with
nails, and have some experience swinging it, you spend less time
worrying about the hammering and more time worrying about your
furniture.

So now would be a good time to roll out [PEP 20, The Zen of Python] (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

This lecture will be structured as follows: I will be teaching the
basics of two things: the python programming language (to a greater
extent) and the ipython interpreter (to a lesser extent). The ipython
interpreter is one of many different ways to implement python code. As
far as the python component, I'll shoot for a layered approach: I'l
continue building on my previous concepts. It turns out that like any
sufficiently complex topic, its not really possible to force the
pedagogy into a serial stream. Also, we have a pretty serious time
constraint. I'm just going to drop it on you. Because of the brief
nature of this tutorial, I've included links to some excellent
reference material. Also, if we have time, I'll take questions based
on the specific programming needs of this class.

Here is the reference material.

## IPython

You can run python commands in a handful of ways; you can create
executable scripts, you can run the python interpreter, you can run
IPython, or you can run IPython notebook.  IPython is an alternative
to the built-in Python interpreter with some nice features.  IPython
notebook gives you interactive access to the python interpreter from
within a browser window, and it allows you to save your commands as a
"notebook".  Lets give the built-in interpreter a spin just this once.

```
swc@swc:~$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 20 2012, 22:44:07) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print "hello world"
hello world
>>> quit() 
```

We can also write python commands in a file and execute them from the
command line. You will notice that the print command above is located
in the file hello.py. Execute the following command at the command
line

```
swc@swc:~$ python hello.py
```

IPython has more useful features for interactive use than the standard
python interpreter, so we'll use it from here on out.

```python
swc@swc:~$ ipython notebook
In [1]: print "hello world"
hello world
In [2]: 
```

You may notice if you hit ENTER your current command does not execute.
ENTER puts a line break in your current command, and allows you to
write multi-line commands and have them all executed at once.
SHIFT-ENTER sends the line that your cursor is on to the interpreter.
The output of the command, or the error message, appears below the
line you entered it on.

```
In [2]: print "hello"
        print "world"
hello
world
In [3]: 
```

### Pasting

You can paste things into the ipython console by copying text from
your machine with **ctrl+c** and typing **%paste** at the IPython
prompt.

### History

IPython has a history. If you press the up and down keys, you can
access the history.

### Tab Completion

IPython also has tab completion of previous commands. Try typing
"print" and then hit the tab key.

### Getting Help

IPython has some nice help features. Lets say we want to know more
about the integer data type. There are at least two ways to do this
task:

```python
In [1] help(int)
```

or 

```python
In [1] int?
```

If you wanted to see all the commands available for something, use the
dir command. Check out all of the methods of the str type.

```python
In [1] dir(str)
```

### Executing code in files

If your code is in a file, you can execute it from the IPython shell
with the **%run** command. Execute hello.py like so

```python
In [1] %run hello.py
```

### Clearing IPython

To clear everything from IPython, use the reset command.

```python
In [1] reset
Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])?
```

## Variables

All programming languages have variables, and python is no
different. To create a variable, just name it and set it with the
equals sign. One important caveat: variable names can only contain
letters, numbers, and the underscore character. Lets set a variable.

```python
In [1]: experiment = "current vs. voltage"

In [2]: print experiment
current vs. voltage

In [3]: voltage = 2

In [4]: current = 0.5

In [5]: print voltage, current
2 0.5
```

## Types and Dynamic Typing

Like most programming languages, things in python are typed. The type
refers to the type of data. We've already defined three different
types of data in experiment, voltage, and current. The types are
string, integer, and float. You can inspect the type of a variable by
using the type command.

```python
In [6]: type(experiment)
Out[6]: <type 'str'>

In [7]: type(voltage)
Out[7]: <type 'int'>

In [8]: type(current)
Out[8]: <type 'float'>
```

Python is a dynamically typed language (unlike, say, C++). If you know
what that means, you may be feeling some fear and loathing right
now. If you don't know what dynamic typing means, the next stuff may
seem esoteric and pedantic. Its actually important, but its importance
may not be clear to you until long after this class is over.

Dynamic typing means that you don't have to declare the type of a
variable when you define it; python just figures it out based on how
you are setting the variable. Lets say you set a variable. Sometime
later you can just change the type of data assigned to a variable and
python is perfectly happy about that. Since it won't be obvious until
(possibly much) later why that's important, I'll let you marinate on
that idea for a second.

Here's an example of dynamic typing. What's the type of data assigned
to voltage?

```python
In [9]: type(voltage)
Out[9]: <type 'int'>
```

Lets assign a value of 2.7 (which is clearly a float) to voltage. What
happens to the type?

```python
In [10]: voltage = 2.7

In [11]: type(voltage)
Out[11]: <type 'float'>
```

You can even now assign a string to the variable voltage and python
would be happy to comply.

```python
In [12]: voltage = "2.7 volts"

In [13]: type(voltage)
Out[13]: <type 'str'>
```

I'll let you ruminate on the pros and cons of this construction while I change the value of voltage back to an int:

```python
In [14]: voltage = 2
```

## Coercion

It is possible to coerce (a fancy and slightly menacing way to say
"convert") certain types of data to other types. For example, its
pretty straightforward to coerce numerical data to strings.

```python
In [19]: voltageString = str(voltage)

In [20]: currentString = str(current)

In [21]: voltageString
Out[21]: '2'

In [22]: type(voltageString)
Out[22]: <type 'str'>
``` 

As you might imagine, you can go the other way in certain cases. Lets
say you had numerical data in a string.

```python
In [23]: resistanceString = "4.0"

In [24]: resistance = float(resistanceString)

In [25]: resistance
Out[25]: 4.0

In [26]: type(resistance)
Out[26]: <type 'float'>
```

What would happen if you tried to coerce resistanceString to an int?
What about coercing resistance to an int? Consider the following:

```python
In [27] resistanceString = "4.0 ohms"
```

Do you think you can coerce that string to a numerical type?

## On Being Precise with floats and ints

Again, the following may seem esoteric and pedantic, but it is very important. So bear with me.

Lets say you had some voltage data that looks like the following

```
0
0.5
1
1.5
2
```

Obviously, if you just assigned this data individually to a variable, you'd end up with the following types

```
0   -> int
0.5 -> float
1   -> int
1.5 -> float
2   -> int
```

But what if you wanted all of that data to be floats on its way in? You could assign the variable and then coerce it to type float:

```python
In [28]: voltage = float(1)
```

But that's ugly. If you want whats otherwise an integer to be a float, just add a period at the end

```python
In [29]: voltage = 1.

In [30]: type(voltage)
Out[30]: <type 'float'>
```

This point becomes important when we start operating on data in the next section.

## Data Operations

In this section all of the discussion in the previous section becomes
important. I don't know if I'd call this stuff fundamental to the
language, but its pretty important and it will zing you if you aren't
careful. The takeaway is that you need to be precise with what you are
doing. Lets say you want to add some integers.

```python
In [31]: a = 1

In [32]: b = 2

In [33]: c = a+b

In [34]: c
Out[34]: 3

In [38]: type(a), type(b), type(c)
Out[38]: (<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>)
```

So we got a vale of three for the sum, which also happens to be an
integer. Any operation between two integers is another integer. Makes
sense.

So what about the case where a is an integer and b is a float?

```python
In [39]: a = 1

In [40]: b = 2.

In [41]: c = a + b

In [42]: c
Out[42]: 3.0

In [43]: type(a), type(b), type(c)
Out[43]: (<type 'int'>, <type 'float'>, <type 'float'>)
```

You can do multiplication on numbers as well.

```python
In [44]: a = 2

In [45]: b = 3

In [46]: c = a * b

In [47]: c
Out[47]: 6

In [48]: type(a), type(b), type(c)
Out[48]: (<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>)
```

Also division.

```python
In [49]: a = 1

In [50]: b = 2

In [51]: c = a / b

In [52]: c
Out[52]: 0
```

**ZING!**

Here's why type is important. Divding two integers returnes an integer: this operation calculates the quotient and floors the result to get the answer.

If everything was a float, the division is what you would expect.

```python
In [53]: a = 1.

In [54]: b = 2.

In [55]: c = a / b

In [56]: c
Out[56]: 0.5

In [57]: type(a), type(b), type(c)
Out[57]: (<type 'float'>, <type 'float'>, <type 'float'>)
```

There are operations that can be done with strings.

```python
In [58]: firstName = "Johann"

In [59]: lastName = "Gambolputty"

In [60]: fullName = firstName + lastName

In [61]: print fullName
JohannGambolputty
```

When concatenating strings, you have to be explicit since computers don't understand context.

```python
In [62]: fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

In [63]: print fullName
Johann Gambolputty
```

There are other operations deined on string data. Use the dir comnand
to find them. One example I'll show is the upper method. Lets take a
look at the documentation.

```python
In [64]: str.upper?
Type:           method_descriptor
Base Class:     <type 'method_descriptor'>
String Form:    <method 'upper' of 'str' objects>
Namespace:      Python builtin
Docstring:
    S.upper() -> string                                                                                                                        
    
    Return a copy of the string S converted to uppercase.
```

So we can use it to upper-caseify a string. 

```python
In [65]: fullName.upper()
Out[65]: 'JOHANN GAMBOLPUTTY'
```

You have to use the parenthesis at the end because upper is a method
of the string class.

For what its worth, you don't need to have a variable to use the
upper() method, you could use it on the string itself.

```python
In [66]: "Johann Gambolputty".upper()
Out[66]: 'JOHANN GAMBOLPUTTY'
```

What do you think should happen when you take upper of an int?  What about a string representation of an int?

That wraps up this lesson. We tried out the IPython shell and got some
experience with ints, floats, and strings. Along the way we talked
about some philosophy and how programming is about people.
