# # Exercise 2
# 1. Make a list with 5 things in it.
# <codecell>
  
# 1. Add two more things.
# <codecell>
   
# <markdowncell>
# # Exercise 2
# 1. Make a dictionary whose keys are the strings "zero" through "nine" and whose values are ints 0 through 9.
# <codecell>
digitsdict = {}
#  Your code goes here

# <markdowncell>
# # Exercise 3
# 1. Make a dictionary and experiment using different types as keys. Can containers be keys?

# # Exercises 4
# 1. Write an if statement that prints whether x is even or odd
# <codecell>
x=4
print x
if x < 5:
  print "x is less than five!"
else: 
  print "x is not less than five!"

# # Exercises 5
# 1. Using a loop, calculate the factorial of 42 (the product of all integers up to and including 42).

# <codecell>
   
# <markdowncell>

# # Exercises 6
# 1. Create a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

# # Exercise 7
# 7A. Read the file 'big_animals.txt' and print each line and the length of each line.
# <codecell>

# 7B. Read the file 'big_animals.txt' again and print each line where the number of animals sighted is greater than 10.  We'll won't output the lines with fewer than 10 animals.
# <codecell>

# 7C. Read the file 'big_animals.txt' again and return a list of tuples.
# <codecell>

# 7D. Turn the code for #7C into a function and use it on the files 'merida_animals.txt' and 'fergus_animals.txt'.
