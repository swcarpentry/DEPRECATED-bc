**absolute path**: <a name="absolute-path"></a>
A [path](#path) that refers to a particular location in a file system.
Absolute paths are usually written with respect to the file system's
[root directory](#root-directory),
and begin with either "/" (on Unix) or "\\" (on Microsoft Windows).
See also: [relative path](#relative-path).

**additive color model**: <a name="additive-color-model"></a>
A way to represent colors as the sum of contributions from primary colors
such as [red, green, and blue](#rgb).

**aggregation function**: <a name="aggregation-function"></a>

**alias** (a library): <a name="alias-library"></a>
To give a library a nickname while importing it.

**assertion**: <a name="assertion"></a>
An expression which is supposed to be true at a particular point in a program.
Programmers typically put assertions in their code to check for errors;
if the assertion fails (i.e., if the expression evaluates as false),
the program halts and produces an error message.
See also: [invariant](#invariant), [precondition](#precondition), [postcondition](#postcondition).

**assignment**: <a name="assignment"></a>
To give a value a name by associating a variable with it.

**atomic value**: <a name="atomic-value"></a>

For example,
the number 12 is usually considered atomic
(unless we are teaching addition to school children,
in which case we might decompose it into tens and ones).

**call stack**: <a name="call-stack"></a>
A data structure inside a running program that keeps track of active function calls.
Each call's variables are stored in a [stack frame](#stack-frame);
a new stack frame is put on top of the stack for each call,

and other languages have other conventions.

The portion of a file's name that comes after the final "." character.
By convention this identifies the file's type:
`.txt` means "text file",
`.png` means "Portable Network Graphics file",
and so on.
These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems:
it is perfectly possible to name an MP3 sound file `homepage.html`.

By convention Unix applications use a dash followed by a single letter,
such as `-v`,
