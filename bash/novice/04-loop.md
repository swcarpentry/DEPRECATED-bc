Loops
=====

Wildcards and tab completion are two ways to reduce typing (and typing mistakes).
Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.
Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `unicorn.dat`, and so on.
When new files arrive,
we'd like to rename the existing ones to `original-basilisk.dat` and `original-unicorn.dat`.
We can't use:

    mv *.dat original-*.dat

because that would expand (in the two-file case) to:

    mv basilisk.dat unicorn.dat

This wouldn't back up our files:
it would replace the content of `unicorn.dat` with whatever's in `basilisk.dat`.

Instead, we can use a [loop](../../gloss.html#for-loop)
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:

    $ for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
    > do
    >    head -3 $filename
    > done
    COMMON NAME: basilisk
    CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
    UPDATED: 1745-05-02
    COMMON NAME: unicorn
    CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
    UPDATED: 1738-11-24

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing in a list.
In this case, the list is the two filenames.
Each time through the loop,
the name of the thing currently being operated on is assigned to
the [variable](../../gloss.html#variable) called `filename`.
Inside the loop,
we get the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it:
`$filename` is `basilisk.dat` the first time through the loop,
`unicorn.dat` the second,
and so on.
Finally,
the command that's actually being run is our old friend `head`,
so this loop prints out the first three lines of each data file in turn.

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:

    for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
    do
        head -3 $x
    done

or:

    for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
    do
        head -3 $temperature
    done

it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so using meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increases the likelihood of the program being wrong.

Here's a slightly more complicated loop:

    for filename in *.dat
    do
        echo $filename
        head -100 $filename | tail -20
    done

The shell starts by expanding `*.dat` to create the list of files it will process.
The [loop body](../../gloss.html#loop-body)
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first, `echo`, just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
For example:

    echo hello there

prints:

    hello there

In this case,
since the shell expands `$filename` to be the name of a file,
`echo $filename` just prints the name of the file.
Note that we can't write this as:

    for filename in *.dat
    do
        $filename
        head -100 $filename | tail -20
    done

because then the first time through the loop,
when `$filename` expanded to `basilisk.dat`, the shell would try to run `basilisk.dat` as a program.
Finally,
the `head` and `tail` combination selects lines 81-100 from whatever file is being processed.

Going back to our original file renaming problem,
we can solve it using this loop:

    for filename in *.dat
    do
        mv $filename original-$filename
    done

This loop runs the `mv` command once for each filename.
The first time,
when `$filename` expands to `basilisk.dat`,
the shell executes:

    mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat

The second time, the command is:

    mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat

### Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files

Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files&mdash;remember,
these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z':

    $ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
    $ for datafile in *[AB].txt
    do
        echo $datafile
    done
    NENE01729A.txt
    NENE01729B.txt
    NENE01736A.txt
    ...
    NENE02043A.txt
    NENE02043B.txt

Her next step is to decide
what to call the files that the `goostat` analysis program will create.
Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
so she modifies her loop to do that:

    $ for datafile in *[AB].txt
    do
        echo $datafile stats-$datafile
    done
    NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
    NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
    NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
    ...
    NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
    NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt
    $

She hasn't actually run `goostats` yet,
but now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.

Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
so instead of re-entering her loop,
she presses the up arrow.
In response,
the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):

    $ for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done

Using the left arrow key,
Nelle backs up and changes the command `echo` to `goostats`:

    $ for datafile in *[AB].txt; do goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done

When she presses enter,
the shell runs the modified command.
However, nothing appears to happen&mdash;there is no output.
After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.
She kills the job by typing Control-C,
uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
and edits it to read:

    $ for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile; goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done

When she runs her program now,
it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:

    NENE01729A.txt
    NENE01729B.txt
    NENE01736A.txt
    ...

1518 times 5 seconds,
divided by 60,
tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
As a final check,
she opens another terminal window,
goes into `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`,
and uses `cat stats-NENE01729B.txt`
to examine one of the output files.
It looks good,
so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.

>       458  goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
>       459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
>       460  history
> 
> then she can re-run `goostats` on `NENE01729B.txt` simply by typing

### Challenges

1.  Suppose that `ls` initially displays:

        fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat

    What is the output of:

        for datafile in *.dat
        do
            ls *.dat
        done

2.  In the same directory, what is the effect of this loop?

        for sugar in *.dat
        do
            echo $sugar
            cat $sugar > xylose.dat
        done

    1.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, and `sucrose.dat`, and
        copies `sucrose.dat` to create `xylose.dat`.
    2.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, and `sucrose.dat`, and
        concatenates all three files to create `xylose.dat`.
    3.  Prints `fructose.dat`, `glucose.dat`, `sucrose.dat`, and
        `xylose.dat`, and copies `sucrose.dat` to create `xylose.dat`.
    4.  None of the above.

3.  The `expr` does simple arithmetic using command-line parameters:

        $ expr 3 + 5
        8
        $ expr 30 / 5 - 2
        4

    Given this, what is the output of:

        for left in 2 3
        do
            for right in $left
            do
                expr $left + $right
            done
        done

4.  Describe in words what the following loop does.

        for how in frog11 prcb redig
        do
            $how -limit 0.01 NENE01729B.txt
        done
