`What is the shell how do I access the shell?`

The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface which
allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a
keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with
a mouse/keyboard combination.

A *terminal* is a program you run that gives you access to the
shell. There are many different terminal programs that vary across
operating systems. To open the default terminal in Ubuntu, just
click... or just use the keys <ctrl><alt>t

There are many reasons to learn about the shell. In my opinion, the
most important reasons are that:
1. It is very common to encounter the shell and
command-line-interfaces in scientific computing, so you will probably
have to learn it eventually
2. The shell is a really powerful way of interacting with your
computer. GUIs and the shell are complementary - by knowing both you
will greatly expand the range of tasks you can accomplish with your
computer. You will also be able to perform many tasks more
efficiently.
