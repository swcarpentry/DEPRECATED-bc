title: Teaching Software Carpentry
---
As a species,
we know a lot about how brains learn,
how effective various teaching practices are,
and how society's needs and expectations shape how and how well we learn.
As individuals,
though,
most people who teach at college and university either don't know this knowledge exists,
or haven't incorporated it into their teaching.

The goal of this short training course is
to introduce people to the basics of educational psychology and instructional design,
and show them how to use those ideas to teach programming to free-range adult learners.
We can only touch a few scattered highlights,
but we hope that will be enough to convince you that it's worth learning more.

Throughout,
it's important to remember what H.L. Mencken wrote almost a century ago:
"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."
People are complicated,
and no general rule applies to everyone and all the time.
You should always use your own best judgment
when applying the ideas discussed below to your learners.

If you find this course useful,
please also have a look at [the teaching guide]({{page.root}}/novice/teaching/index.html)
for Software Carpentry itself.
And if you discover something you think others would want to know,
please send it to us:
we are always grateful for contributions and corrections.
