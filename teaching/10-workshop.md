Software Carpentry Instructors Training Workshops
=================================================

1. Make a Screencast Before the Workshop
----------------------------------------

There should be a pre-defined set of lessons for making
screencasts. They should all come from the Software Carpentry
core. The trainees could only pick a topic from this set.

Reasons:

a) helps the trainees make up their mind;

b) it is about seeing oneself teach but also they are supposed to
   teach SWC so the topic *should* be from SWC;

c) the screencasts may be compared (if the participants want to do it
   --- it would be a voluntary step).

After the screencasts are done and the participants received the
feedback from the other two from the group, they could be regrouped
based on the choice of the topic they decided to teach. That is those
who made a screencast on "Loops in Python" would get together and so
on. They don't have to watch their videos (in fact there is no time
for that) but discuss their experience and the feedback they
received. They could also compare their strategies and approaches to
teaching the topic.

The set of topics should be send a few days before and the
participants should be reminded that they will have to record
themselves.

Reasons:

a) in Toronto some people didn't have enough time to prepare overnight
   for making the screencast;

b) some participants said they would have brought better recording
   devices.

2. Observe the Instructor Teach a Module from the SWC Core
----------------------------------------------------------

The trainees act as students.  The instructor teachers a part of a
selected module from the SWC core (for example, something like head
and tail from the shell lecture). The teaching itself would be 10-15
mins. 3-4 trainees could be helpers (or the instructors present at the
training would be helpers).

All trainees have feedback forms which they fill in.  Once the
teaching is finished, there is a group discussion on what was good,
what was bad, which teaching approaches and tricks the trainees picked
up.  More importantly, they learn how to give feedback on teaching.

3. Multiple Choice Questions With Distractors
---------------------------------------------

The goal of this task is to develop way of analysing of the potential
misconceptions which students may have. The instructors need to also
become aware how they themselves may induce such misconceptions.

a) In groups of 3 the trainees come up with 3 questions and 4 answers
   to each, and explanations for the wrong answers ("why the student
   could choose one of the wrong answers");

b) the groups exchange the questions with answers between them (but
   not reveal the explanation). The other group has to come up with
   the explanations for the wrong answers. This exercise will allow
   the group that came up with the wrong answers to see whether they
   can "simulate" student's mind and understand possible
   misconceptions. Also, trying to understand what could be the
   explanation behind the wrong that the other group created is a more
   realistic exercise --- as if they actually tried to guess the
   reason behind the wrong answer.

4. Strategies for Preparing to Teach Unfamiliar Material
--------------------------------------------------------

a) Come clean - tell the hosts, the administator and the other
   instructor which module(s) you would rather not teach because you
   are still not very confident with the material.

b) Negotiate with the other instructor splitting the material so that
   each one of you teaches the bit that you know/are comfortable with.

c) Train yourself up! Go through the whole material of a given module
   and learn it; write down all bits that you don't understand. Then
   go through it again, as if you were teaching --- this will reveal
   even more bits of material that you don't quite get! Are you really
   sure what happens in Git when you create a branch?


> TIP: It will take you 3-4 times longer than you estimate to prepare
> for teaching material that you are not familiar with or that you
> have never taught before.

5. Being a Lead Instructor

"It sounds more scary than it really is." The goal of this session is
to make the trainees more comfortable with the responsibilities and
the work of the lead instructors; and to make them ready for this
role.

a) Trainees read through the section on the website on "how to be a
   lead instructor" (this could be a homework to be done in the
   evening of Day 1 or even sent out earlier).

b) They write down things that they:

   * don't understand / don't know how to do; or

   * think they will struggle with.

c) Then they work in groups of 3-4. Each person picks one thing from
   the above two lists (so two issues) and the group tries to find
   answers/solutions to them.

d) The instructor talks about the "mentorship" - where/how to get help
   from more experienced instructors who have been leads several
   times.

6. Creating a Bootcamp Repository and Web Site
----------------------------------------------

This task is to simulate what normally a lead instructor has to do,
how long it takes, identify what problems they may face (both
technical, like needing help with Git, and contents, like needing to
liaise with hosts to get info about venue and hours). They will also
(hopefully) see that it's not that scary. And even if we change the
whole structure, they will have more confidence they can do it. Also,
they should be encouraged to provide feedback (PRs!) on the
instructions written for setting up a repo, find bugs etc.

This could be homework after Day1, or homework after the Train the
Trainers event.

7. How Not to Teach
-------------------

The goal of this session is to make the trainees aware what kinds of
their behaviour, wording, style of teaching may cause more damage than
good.

a) Telling students that they are doing "rubbish work" because they
   use Excel, Word; they don't modularise their code; don't test it
   etc. etc.

b) Perpetually complaining about Windows/Mac and praising Linux/Unix -
   juxtaposing the former as "for amateurs/not real OS/broken OS" with
   the latter ("for professionals/for *real* geeks/for real,serious
   tasks")

c) Criticizing GUI appications and describing command-line tools as
   "the only ones that do the job". Even worse, an instructor putiing
   himself/herself in a position of a "guru": "I'm a real programmer;
   don't know anything about that silly Windows stuff." By doing this
   you intimidate the students. Many of them have already been
   intimidated and came to SWC hoping to get help.

d) Not managing expectations. Start with the hosts when you negotiate
   the curriculum. Make sure that they understand the main goals and
   purpose of SWC (we target beginners; it's not about the intrisics
   of object oriented programming). It's usually the leading
   instructors job but the SWC admin may be able to help you, if the
   hosts don't seem to be getting the message through. It is really
   crucial to make it clear to them because it's them who will be
   advertising/recommenting SWC workshop to the students. If they
   misadvertise it, you may end up with an audience who will be very
   disappointed they are taught how to modularise their code whilst
   they actually wanted to learn some MPI ("I thought it was supposed
   to be about scientific programming!"). Once you sorted the hosts,
   you should still make it clear to the attendees at the beginning of
   Day 1 what you and the other instructor will be doing over the
   course of the following two days and why you do it this way.

e) Diving into discussing really complex and difficult questions asked
   by 1-2 people in the audience who clearly don't really need
   SWC. They already know it all and want to discuss whether Scala is
   better than Haskell. If you, as an instructor, engage in these
   questions because you feel they are far more interesting than
   teaching how to create functions in Python, you probably should not
   be an SWC instructor. If teaching beginners is *boring* for you and
   you'd rather have advanced discussions, instructing at SWC
   workshops is probably not be best way you could contribute to
   SWC. Maybe you'd be interested in debugging a number of srcipts
   which help to run our infrastructure? Or help with the admintool?

f) Hide your impostor syndrome. If you suffer from the impostor
   syndrome, learn how to use it to your advantage. Remember that
   SWC's main goal is to help people who need to improve relatively
   basic software engineering and development skills (though their
   research/domain knowledge is probably very good). They will feel
   more at ease if you aren't afraid to admit that you don't think
   you're an expert on a given topic. But don't overdo it - you don't
   want to give an impression that SWC instructors know nothing about
   computers. We at least know how to switch them on.

8. How to Help SWC Grow
-----------------------

At the beginning and at the end of each workshop encourage the
attendees and helpers to get engaged in Software Carpentry. Have a
slide ready showing different ways to engage and the path: attendee ->
helper -> instructor. Have the information ready about the instructors
training and point people to the right website
(http://teaching.software-carpentry.org). Make sure that you challenge
the misconception that an SWC instructor must be an experienced
software developer with a degree in Computer Science. Give examples of
some of the instructors who are just like the members of the
audience.

9. Code of Conduct
------------------

Make sure everyone understands what it is, where it is, and that
compliance is not optional.

10. Dealing With Audiences With Varying Knowledge and Skills
------------------------------------------------------------

a) Get the smart ones to be helpers. Occassionally, in collaboration
   with the hosts (of they know the audience very very well), you may
   be able to pair people up so that the beginners sit together with a
   more advanced person.

b) Manage expectations (see 7.d).
