## Scaling Instruction

We said earlier that clearing up novices' misconceptions is more important than imparting "mere information".
However,
we also said that when novices misunderstand something,
they can all misunderstand it differently.
How can one instructor clear up the different misconceptions of forty or four hundred people at a time?

The best solution we have so far is called peer instruction.
Originally developed by Eric Mazur,
it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts,
including programming.
When it is used,
the basic learning cycle is typically something like this:

1. The instructor presents a multiple-choice question.
2. Learners choose an answer
   (typically using clickers or by holding up multi-colored cards).
3. Learners discuss their answers in small groups (typically 3-4 people) and re-vote.
4. The instructor presents and explains the correct answer.
5. Learners re-group to discuss the solution.

The second discussion stage is crucial,
because that's where group members clear up each other's misconceptions.
This part of the cycle is what makes the technique scale:
with three or four people per group,
the odds are good that at least one person will understand what a partner has misunderstood,
and be able to clarify it for them.

We don't use peer instruction in our workshops,
partly because it depends on people having looked at material before they come to class
(which most won't actually do),
and partly because learning how to take part in peer instruction is extraneous cognitive load
for people who are also trying to learn how to program.
What we've done instead is require learners to do exercises in pairs,
i.e.,
have two (or three) people share a laptop and talk to each other as they do each exercise.
This practice is called pair programming,
and many studies have shown its effectiveness in industry.
It works because weak learners get individualized explanations,
while stronger ones learn from explaining things.
It's particularly effective if pairs are re-formed periodically,
i.e.,
if people are required to sit beside someone new after every break
so that weak-weak and strong-strong pairs don't persist.
(On the other hand,
this can make some people more inhibited,
since eventually they'll be paired with a stranger.)
