Students are required to read:

- Mark Guzdial:
  "[Why Programming is Hard to Teach](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/guzdial.pdf)".
  A chapter from *[Making Software](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)*
  that explores why programming seems so much harder to teach than some other standard subjects.
  Instructors should also read Guzdial's [blog](http://computinged.wordpress.com) to keep up with new developments.

- Susan Ambrose et al:
  *[How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching](http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/)*.
  An excellent overview of what we know about education and why we believe it's true,
  covering everything from cognitive psychology to social factors.

In addition, instructors are expected to have read:

- Ken Bain:
  *[What the Best College Teachers Do](http://www.amazon.com/What-Best-College-Teachers-Do/dp/0674013255/)*.
  Brief and entertaining, though a bit gushy at times.

- Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning:
  *[How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School](http://www.amazon.com/How-People-Learn-Experience-Expanded/dp/0309070368/)*.
  Another good guide to the cognitive science of learning, largely superseded by *How Learning Works*.

- Larry Cuban:
  *[Oversold and Underused: Computers in the Classroom](http://www.amazon.com/Oversold-Underused-Computers-Larry-Cuban/dp/0674011090/)*.
  A critical look at why teachers *don't* use computers, based on the author's research in Silicon Valley school districts.

- Julie Dirksen:
  *[Design for How People Learn](http://www.amazon.com/Design-People-Learn-Voices-Matter/dp/0321768434/)*.
  Describes ways of applying user experience design principles to learning materials.

- Carol Dweck:
  *[Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322/)*.
  An excellent research-based exploration of fixed vs. growth mindset (despite its pop-psych subtitle).

- Robert Glass:
  *[Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/)*.
  Dated, but still the best short guide we have to evidence-based software engineering.
  Instructors need to know this material in order to explain why our workshops cover the things they do.

- Therese Huston:
  *[Teaching What You Don't Know](http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674066170)*.
  A pointed, funny, and very useful book that explores exactly what the title suggests.

- Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher:
  *[Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing](http://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Clubhouse-Computing-Jane-Margolis/dp/0262632691/)*.
  A groundbreaking report on the gender imbalance in computing, and the steps Carnegie-Mellon took to address the problem.

- Andy Oram and Greg Wilson (eds):
  *[Making Software: What Reall Works, and Why We Believe It](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)*.
  A collection of essays on evidence-based results in software engineering written to update and expand Glass's book.

- Amanda Ripley:
  *[The Smartest Kids in the World: And How They Got That Way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Smartest-Kids-World-They/dp/145165443X/)*.
  Compares the American school system with those of South Korea, Finland, and Poland
  to find out why other countries consistently outperform the US while spending less per student.

- Pasi Sahlberg:
  *[Finnish Lessons: What Can the World Learn from Educational Change in Finland?](http://www.amazon.com/Finnish-Lessons-Educational-Change-Finland/dp/0807752576/)*.
  A description of one of the world's most successful school systems from one of its architects.

- Claude M. Steele:
  *[Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do](http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/0393339726/)*.
  Explains and explores stereotype threat and strategies for addressing it.

- Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe:
  *[Understanding by Design](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Expanded-Grant-Wiggins/dp/0131950843)*.
  A very slow-paced description of reverse instructional design.

- Daniel Willingham:
  *[Why Don't Students Like School](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Dont-Students-Like-School/dp/047059196X/)*.
  A collection from the author's *Ask the Cognitive Scientist* column: uneven, but contains a few gems.
