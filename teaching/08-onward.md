This training course only a shadow of what it needs to be.
If you'd like to help us make it better,
we would welcome additions discussing:

* how education research is done: qualitative studies, quantitative studies, and comparison studies
* Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, Freire (or, key figures in 100 words each)
* the history of distance education (or, everything old is new again)
* MOOCs
* are public schools actually failing?
* classroom management basics
* computer-based homework/teaching systems
* concept inventories
* developing homework (and in-class tasks?) that build expertise.
* direct instruction vs. problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning
* expertise in three parts: prior knowledge, knowledge frameworks, and metacognition
* other forms of assessment
* interactive engagement overview across STEM
* learning objectives/outcomes/goals
* learning styles as an example of an educational fad
* (much) more about motivation and learning
* an overview of research on novice programmers
* open licensing for education, creative commons, open educational resources (OER)
* more on peer instruction
* problem-solving skills overview
* setting expectations in the classroom/promoting effective study habits
* more on stereotype threat
* writing effective multiple choice questions
