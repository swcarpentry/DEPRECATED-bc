This folder contains some font file(s) that have been obtained from google webfonts.
We keep a local copy in the repository in order to allow presentation to run offline properly.

At the time of writing, Google fonts are said to be "open source"
and "you can use them in every way you want, privately or commercially â€” in print, on your computer, or in your websites".
<http://www.google.com/fonts/#AboutPlace:about>

The fonts are obtained using a tool available here:
