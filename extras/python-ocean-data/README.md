## Capstone example for Oceanography

While this capstone example is labelled for oceanography, 
it deals with surface current data 
(which is analogous to wind data)
and is therefore also relevant for weather and climate scientists.  

Please contact the author (Damien Irving; irving.damien@gmail.com) if you use this lesson at a workshop,
