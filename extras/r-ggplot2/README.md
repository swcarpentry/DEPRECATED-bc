title: Data visualization with ggplot2
level: misc
---

This lesson contains an Rmd file with code and documentation for an introduction to the **ggplot2** package for data visualization. Upon completing this lesson, learners will be able to use ggplot2 to explore high-dimensional data by faceting and scaling scatter plots in small multiples.

The first half of the lesson uses the `qplot` convenience function, as it will be intuitive for learners already familiar with **base** graphics. Furthermore, when searching for help with **ggplot2**, learners will inevitably encounter examples using `qplot`.

The second half of the lesson introduces the grammar of graphics and the more comprehensive `ggplot` function for creating plots layer-by-layer. It introduces learners to the philosophy of `ggplot`, recreates several of the examples in the first half of the lesson using `ggplot`, and demonstrates creating other types of plots with `ggplot`.

The lesson should take approximately 30 minutes. Learners should already have a basic introduction to R, including:

* Installing and loading packages
* Loading built-in data with the `data()` function
* Inspecting data frames with `head()`, `str()`, etc.
* Basic plotting using base graphics

---

* FIXME: add more examples of novel types of visualization using `ggplot` other than "named" plots like scatter plots, histograms, etc.
* FIXME: Populate the exercise under the `qplot` section.
* FIXME: Add another exercise at the (current) end of the `ggplot` lesson.
