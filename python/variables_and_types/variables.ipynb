I expect this lecture to be interactive, so stop me at any point if you have questions. The correct power dynamic is that people are the masters and the machines are servants. The computer is a hammer; it exists to help us get things done.  We can hammer nails with the handle, with the claw of the hammer; some of us even hammer nails with bricks.  But when you learn what part of the hammer works best with nails, and have some experience swinging it, you spend less time worrying about the hammering and more time worrying about your furniture."
