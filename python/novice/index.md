title: Programming with Python
level: novice
---
The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:
data analysis.

Our real goal isn't to teach you Python,
but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.
We use Python in our lessons because:

1.  we have to use *something* for examples;
2.  it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
3.  it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and
4.  experience shows that it's easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.
