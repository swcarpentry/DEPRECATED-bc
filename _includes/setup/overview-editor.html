<h4>Editor</h4>
<p>
  When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
  editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
  like automatic color-coding of key words.
  The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
  which is not famous for being intuitive.
  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
  try typing the escape key,
  followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
  then hitting Return
  to return to the shell.
