  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    Python is becoming more and more popular in scientific computing,
    and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
    We will be using Python version 2.7.
    Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
    so we recommend using an all-in-one installer.
