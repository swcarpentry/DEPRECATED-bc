<h4>Python</h4>
<p>
  Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
  and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
  We teach with Python version 2.7,
  since it is still the most widely used.
  Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
  so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
