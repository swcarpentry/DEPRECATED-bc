  <h4>Mac OS X / Bash</h4>







  <p>



    The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,



    so no need to install anything.  You access bash from



    the Terminal (found



    in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want



    to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
