  Fan has inherited an activity log for an experimental project
  formatted as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
2012-11-30: Re-setting equipment.
2012-12-12: First run with acidic reagants.
2012-12-12: Re-ran acidic reagants.
2012-12-14: Tried neutral reagants again.
2013-02-05: Back to this stuff after writing up the CSRTI paper.
2013-02-06: Trying basic reagants this time.
</pre>
<p>
  He has written a function to translate this into
  a dictionary of dictionaries of sets,
  where the outer dictionary's keys are years (as strings),
  the inner dictionary's keys are months (also as strings),
  and the innermost sets are the days (strings again)
  for which there are comments.
  For example,
  the output of this function for the data sample above is supposed to be:
</p>
<pre>
{
    '2012' : {
        '11' : {'30'},
        '12' : {'12', '14'}
    },
    '2013' : {
        '02' : {'05', '06'}
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  His function is:
</p>
<pre>
def extract_dates(filename):
    reader = open(filename, 'r')
    result = {}
    for line in reader:
        year, month, day = line.strip().split(' ', 1)[0].split('-')
        if year not in result:
            pass <span class="comment"># fill in 1</span>
        if month not in result[year]:
            pass <span class="comment"># fill in 2</span>
        pass <span class="comment"># fill in 3</span>
    reader.close()
    return result
</pre>
<p>
  Fill in the three missing lines with a single statement each
  so that this function returns the right answer.
