  A friend of yours argues,
  "Finding a value in an unordered list of length <em>N</em> takes <em>N/2</em> steps on average.
  Finding it in a hash table takes only one step,
  but it's a more expensive step,
  since we have to calculate a hash code for that value.
  We should therefore use lists for small data sets,
  and only use things like sets for large ones."
  Explain the flaws in your friend's reasoning.
