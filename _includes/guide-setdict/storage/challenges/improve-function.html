<p>
  Nelle has inherited the following function:
</p>
<pre>
def is_sample_repeated(left_channel, right_channel, history):
    '''Report repeated samples.  Both channels' values are integers in [0..10] inclusive.'''
    combined = 1000 * left_channel + right_channel
    if combined in history:
        return True
    else:
        history.add(combined)
        return False
</pre>
<p>
  How would you improve this function, and why?
</p>
