<p>
  Nelle has a function that extracts the latitudes and longitudes of data collection sites from a file:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; sites = extract_sites('north-pacific.dat')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sites[:3]
[[52.097, -173.505], [52.071, -173.510], [51.985, -173.507]]
</pre>
<p>
  Write another function called <code>filter_duplicate_sites</code>
  that takes a list of this kind as its only input,
  and returns a set (not a list) containing only the unique latitude/longitude pairs.
</p>
