<p>
  Before sets were added to Python,
  people frequently imitated them using dictionaries;
  the dictionary's keys were the set's elements,
  and the dictionary's values were all <code>None</code>.
  This function calculates the intersection of two such "sets":
</p>
<pre>
def setdict_intersect(left, right):
    '''Return new dictionary with intersection of keys from left and right.'''
    result = {}
    for key in left:
        if key in right:
            result[key] = None
    return result
</pre>
<p>
  Write a function <code>setdict_union</code> that calculates
  the union of two sets represented in this way.
</p>
