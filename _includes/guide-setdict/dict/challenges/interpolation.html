<p>
  Fan has a table with the pH levels of samples as the keys,
  and the percentage of carbon-12 as the values:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>pH</th>
    <th>C12</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.43</td>
    <td>0.48</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.51</td>
    <td>0.47</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.56</td>
    <td>0.45</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  He needs to interpolate between these values,
  i.e.,
  to predict the percentage of carbon-12 in the sample
  for a pH 7.50.
  Will storing his data in a dictionary:
</p>
<pre>
{7.43 : 0.48, 7.51 : 0.47, 7.56 : 0.45}
</pre>
<p>
  be any more efficient than storing it in a list of pairs:
</p>
<pre>
[ [7.43, 0.48], [7.51, 0.47], [7.56, 0.45] ]
</pre>
<p>
  Why or why not?
</p>
