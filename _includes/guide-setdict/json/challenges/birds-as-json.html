<p>
  The bird watching data from
  an earlier section
  was stored like this:
</p>
<pre>
2010-07-03    05:38    loon
2010-07-03    06:02    goose
2010-07-03    06:07    loon
2010-07-04    05:09    ostrich
2010-07-04    05:29    loon
</pre>
<p>
  How would you represent this as JSON?
  If you rewrite the <code>early_bird.py</code> program
  (that finds the earliest time each bird was seen)
  so that it uses your JSON format,
  how much code do you save?
</p>
