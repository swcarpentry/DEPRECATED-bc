<p>
  <code>json.dump</code> has an extra parameter called <code>sort_keys</code>;
  its default value is <code>False</code>,
  but if it is <code>True</code>,
  then all dictionaries are printed with keys in sorted order.
  Explain why this option <em>isn't</em> <code>True</code> by default,
  and how setting it to <code>True</code> can be useful in testing.
