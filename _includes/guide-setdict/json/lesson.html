    The example above used two data file formats:
    one for storing molecular formulas,
    the other for storing inventory.
    Both formats were specific to this application,
    which means we needed to write, debug, document, and maintain functions to handle them.
    Those functions weren't particularly difficult to create,
    but they still took time to create,
    and if anyone ever wants to read our files in Java, MATLAB, or Perl,
    they'll have to write equivalent functions themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    A growing number of programs avoid these problems
    by using a flexible data format called
    <a href="glossary.html#json">JSON</a>,
    which stands for "JavaScript Object Notation".
    Despite the name,
    it is a language-independent way to store nested data structures
    made up of strings, numbers, Booleans, lists, dictionaries,
    and the special value <code>null</code> (equivalent to Python's <code>None</code>)&mdash;in short,
    the basic data types that almost every language supports.
    For example,
    let's convert a dictionary of scientists' birthdays
    to a string:
  </p>

<pre src="setdict/json_first.py">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; birthdays = {'Curie' : 1867, 'Hopper' : 1906, 'Franklin' : 1920}
&gt;&gt;&gt; as_string = json.dumps(birthdays)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print as_string
<span class="out">{"Curie": 1867, "Hopper": 1906, "Franklin": 1920}</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(as_string)
<span class="out">&lt;type 'str'&gt;</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    <code>json.dumps</code> doesn't seem to do much,
    but that's kind of the point:
    the textual representation of the data structure looks pretty much like
    what a programmer would type in to re-create it.
    The advantage is that this representation can be saved in a file:
  </p>

<pre src="setdict/json_second.py">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; original = {'Curie' : 1867, 'Hopper' : 1906, 'Franklin' : 1920}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; writer = open('/tmp/example.json', 'w')
&gt;&gt;&gt; json.dump(original, writer)
&gt;&gt;&gt; writer.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; reader = open('/tmp/example.json', 'r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; duplicate = json.load(reader)
&gt;&gt;&gt; reader.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'original:', original
<span class="out">original: {'Curie': 1867, 'Hopper': 1906, 'Franklin': 1920}</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'duplicate:', duplicate
<span class="out">duplicate: {u'Curie': 1867, u'Hopper': 1906, u'Franklin': 1920}</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'original == duplicate:', original == duplicate
<span class="out">original == duplicate: True</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'original is duplicate:', original is duplicate
<span class="out">original is duplicate: False</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    As the example above shows,
    saving and loading data is as simple as opening a file
    and then calling one function.
    The data file holds what we'd type in to create the data in a program:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat /tmp/example.json</span>
<span class="out">{"Curie": 1867, "Hopper": 1906, "Franklin": 1920}</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    which makes it easy to edit by hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    How is this different in practice from what we had?
    First,
    our inventory file now looks like this:
  </p>

<pre src="setdict/inventory.json">
{"He" : 1,
 "H" : 4,
 "O" : 3}
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    while our formulas files look like:
  </p>

<pre src="setdict/formulas.json">
{"helium"   : {"He" : 1},
 "water"    : {"H" : 2, "O" : 1},
 "hydrogen" : {"H" : 2}}
</pre>

  <p>
    Those aren't as intuitive for non-programmers as the original flat text files,
    but they're not too bad.
    The worst thing is the lack of comments:
    unfortunately&mdash;very unfortunately&mdash;the JSON format
    doesn't support them.
    (And note that JSON requires us to use a double-quote for strings:
    unlike Python,
    we cannot substitute single quotes.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The good news is that given files like these,
    we can rewrite our program as:
  </p>

<pre src="setdict/nanotech_json.py">
'''Calculate how many molecules of each type can be made with the atoms on hand.'''

import sys
import json

def main(argv):
    '''Main driver for program.'''
    inventory = <span class="highlight">read_data(argv[1])</span>
    formulas = <span class="highlight">read_data(argv[2])</span>
    counts = calculate_counts(inventory, formulas)
    show_counts(counts)

<span class="highlight">def read_data(filename):
    '''Read a JSON-formatted data file.'''
    reader = open(filename, 'r')
    result = json.load(reader)
    reader.close()
    return result</span>

def calculate_counts(inventory, formulas):
    <em>...as before...</em>

def dict_divide(inventory, molecule):
    <em>...as before...</em>

def show_counts(counts):
    <em>...as before...</em>

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(sys.argv)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The two functions that read formula and inventory files
    have been replaced with a single function that reads JSON.
    Nothing else has to change,
    because the data structures loaded from the data files
    are exactly what we had before.
    The end result is 51 lines long compared to the 80 we started with,
    a reduction of more than a third.
  </p>

    <h3>Nothing's Perfekt</h3>

    <p>
      JSON's greatest weakness isn't its lack of support for comments,
      but the fact that it doesn't recognize and manage aliases.
      Instead,
      each occurrence of an aliased structure is treated as something brand new
      when data is being saved.
      For example:
    </p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner = ['name']
&gt;&gt;&gt; outer = [inner, inner] <span class="comment"># Creating an alias.</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print outer
<span class="out">[['name'], ['name']]</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print outer[0] is outer[1]
<span class="out">True</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; as_string = json.dumps(outer)
&gt;&gt;&gt; duplicate = json.loads(as_string)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print duplicate
<span class="out">[[u'name'], [u'name']]</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print duplicate[0] is duplicate[1]
<span class="out">False</span>
</pre>
    <p class="continue">
      <a href="#f:json_alias">Figure 9</a> shows the difference between
      the original data structure (referred to by <code>outer</code>)
      and what winds up in <code>duplicate</code>.
      If aliases might be present in our data,
      and it's important to preserve their structure,
      we must either record the aliasing ourself (which is tricky),
      or use some other format.
      Luckily,
      a lot of data either doesn't contain aliases,
      or the aliasing in it isn't important.
