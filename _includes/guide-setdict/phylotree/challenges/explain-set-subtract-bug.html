  What would happen if the line:
</p>
<pre>
species -= {left, right}
</pre>
<p>
  was moved down one line,
  so that it was executed after the call to <code>make_new_pairs</code>?
  (Hint:
  what assumptions does <code>make_new_pairs</code> make
  that wouldn't be true
  if the set subtraction was moved down one line?)
