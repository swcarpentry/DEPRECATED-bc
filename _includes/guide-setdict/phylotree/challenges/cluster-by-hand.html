  Work through the clustering algorithm by hand
  for the following distance matrix:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td>     <td>centaur</td>    <td>hippogriff</td> <td>pegasus</td> <td>unicorn</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>centaur</td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>     <td>&nbsp;</td>     <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>hippogriff</td> <td>19</td>         <td>&nbsp;</td>     <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>pegasus</td>    <td>7</td>          <td>23</td>         <td>&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>unicorn</td>    <td>7</td>          <td>12</td>         <td>15</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Check your answers against the output of the program.
  Would you use this as a test case to check the program's correctness?
  Why or why not?
