<p>
  Fan has the following code:
</p>
<pre>
left = {'He', 'Ar', 'Ne'}
right = set()
while len(left) &gt; len(right):
    temp = left.pop()
    right.add(temp)
</pre>
<p>
  What values could <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> have
  after this code is finished running?
  Explain why your answer makes this code hard to test.
