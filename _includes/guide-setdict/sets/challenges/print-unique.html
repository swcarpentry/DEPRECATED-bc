<p>
  Fan has written a program to print the names of the distinct atoms in a data file:
</p>
<pre>
<span class="comment"># Print the name of each atom in the data file once.</span>
reader = open('atoms.txt', 'r')
seen = set()
for line in reader:
    name = line.strip()
    if name in seen:
        print name
    else:
        seen.add(name)
reader.close()
</pre>
<p>
  When he runs the program on this data file:
</p>
<pre>
Na
Fe
Na
</pre>
<p>
  it only prints:
</p>
<pre>
<span class="out">Na</span>
</pre>
<p>
  What is the simplest change you can make to the program
  so that it produces the correct answer?
