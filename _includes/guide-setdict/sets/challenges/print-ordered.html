<p>
  Fan has created a set containing the names of five noble gases:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print gases
<span class="out">set(['helium', 'argon', 'neon', 'xenon', 'radon'])</span>
</pre>
<p>
  He would like to print them in alphabetical order.
  What is one simple way to do this?
  (Hint: the <code>list</code> function converts its arguments to a list.)
