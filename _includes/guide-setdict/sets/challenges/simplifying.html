  Fan has written the following code:
</p>
<pre>
left = {'He', 'Ar', 'Ne'}
right = {'Ar', 'Xe'}
for element in left:                <span class="comment"># X</span>
    if element not in right:        <span class="comment"># X</span>
        right.add(element)          <span class="comment"># X</span>
assert left.issubset(right)
</pre>
<p>
  What single line could be used
  in place of the three marked with 'X'
  to achieve the same effect?
</p>
