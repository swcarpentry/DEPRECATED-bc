<p>
  Fan has created a set containing the names of five noble gases:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print noble_gases
<span class="out">set(['He', 'Ne', 'Ar', 'Kr', 'Xe'])</span>
</pre>
<p>
  Fan also has a set of "smaller" elements (here 10 or less protons).
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print small_elements
<span class="out">set(['H', 'He', 'Li', 'Be', 'B', 'C', 'N', 'O', 'F', 'Ne'])</span>
</pre>
<p>
  He would like to create two different sets.  One that contains the noble gases
  that contain more than 10 protons, and one that contains the noble gases with
  less than 10 protons.

  What are two ways he can create the first set and what
  are two ways he can create the second set?
