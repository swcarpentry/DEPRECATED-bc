<p>
  Fan has created a set containing the names of five noble gases:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print gases
<span class="out">set(['helium', 'argon', 'neon', 'xenon', 'radon'])</span>
</pre>
<p>
  Fan also was given a set of noble gases that contains the one nobel gas that
  doesn't end with an 'n'.
</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; print loner_gas
<span class="out">set(['helium'])</span>
</pre>
<p>
  He would like to create a set of noble gases that end with an 'n' using only
  the two sets he currently has.  How could he do that? (Hint: Python's sets
  implement set operations.)
