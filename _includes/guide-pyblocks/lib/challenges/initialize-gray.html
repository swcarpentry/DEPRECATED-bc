<p>
  If we want to initialize the grid to something other than black,
  we can pass a color to <code>ImageGrid</code> like this:
</p>
<pre>
<span class="in">example = ImageGrid(6, 5, fill=(128, 255, 128))</span>
</pre>
<p>
  Use this to create an <code>ImageGrid</code> that is medium-gray
  (i.e., all three color values are 128),
  and then change the color of one cell to be successively lighter grays
  until you can see a difference.
  What is the first gray for which this happens?
</li>
