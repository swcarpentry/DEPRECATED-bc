  <p>
    Now that we can do basic arithmetic,
    let's look at where the real power of most programming languages is.
    Run this in an IPython Notebook cell:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">import math
print "pi is", math.pi
print "square root of 5 is", math.sqrt(5)</span>
<span class="out">pi is 3.14159265359
square root of 5 is 2.2360679775</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    The first line in this cell is the most important.
    It tells Python to load a library called <code>math</code> into our program.
    We can then refer to the variables defined inside that library,
    like &pi;,
    as <code><em>library</em>.<em>variable</em></code>,
    and call its functions,
    like square root,
    as <code><em>library</em>.<em>function</em></code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two-part names are used because
    many different libraries can define variables or functions with the same names.
    For example,
    <code>math.log</code> returns the natural logarithm of a number,
    while <code>server.log</code>
    (i.e., the <code>log</code> function defined by the <code>server</code> library)
    writes a log message to a file.
    It's exactly like saying "Valerie's paper" rather than just "the paper".
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Shortcuts</h3>

    <p>
      If we only want a few specific functions from a library,
      we can import them by name and then call them directly:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from math import sqrt
print sqrt(3)</span>
<span class="out">1.7320508075688772</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      We can also import a function under a different name,
      so that if two libraries define functions with the same name,
      we can give one or the other a different name when we want to use them together:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from math import hypot as euclid
print euclid(3, 4)</span>
<span class="out">5.0</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      Finally,
      we can use <code>import *</code>
      to bring everything in the module into the current scope at once.
      This has the same effect as using <code>from module import a</code>,
      <code>from module import b</code>,
      and so on for every name in the module:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from math import *
print sin(pi)</span>
<span class="out">1.2246063538223773e-16</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      <code>import *</code> is usually a bad idea:
      if someone adds a new function or variable to the next version of the module,
      your <code>import *</code> could silently overwrite something that you have written,
      or are importing from somewhere else.
      Bugs like this can be extremely hard to find,
      since nothing seemed to change in your program.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now that we know how to import libraries,
    let's create a grid of colored blocks:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from ipythonblocks import ImageGrid
grid = ImageGrid(10, 5)
grid.show()</span>
{% include guide-pyblocks/lib/blocks-initial-grid.html %}
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The first line loads <code>ImageGrid</code> from the <code>ipythonblocks</code> library.
    When we give <code>ImageGrid</code> two integers,
    it creates a grid of the specified width and height.
    We can assign that grid to a variable
    (in this case, called <code>grid</code>),
    and then ask it to display itself
    by calling a <a href="glossary.html#method">method</a> named <code>show</code>.
    A method is just a function that belongs to a particular object:
    in this case, the grid.
  </p>

  <p>
    Objects can also have <a href="glossary.html#member">members</a>,
    which are just variables attached to the object:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">print 'width:', grid.width
print 'height', grid.height
print 'lines_on', grid.lines_on</span>
<span class="out">width: 10
height: 5
lines_on: True</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    We can change some of the grid's members:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">grid.lines_on = False
grid.show()</span>
{% include guide-pyblocks/lib/blocks-grid-lines-off.html %}
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    but not others:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">grid.width = 100</span>
<span class="err">AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-21-38b1940fb9ea&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 grid.width=100

AttributeError: can't set attribute</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The reason is the same as the one given <a href="#a:add-num-str">earlier</a>
    when talking about why we can't add strings and numbers:
    if we enlarged the grid,
    Python would have to guess what colors to use for the new blocks.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Getting Help</h3>
    <p>
      To find out what methods and members something has,
      we can ask Python for help:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">help(grid)</span>
<span class="out'">class BlockGrid(__builtin__.object)
 |  A grid of blocks whose colors can be individually controlled.
 |  
 |  Parameters
 |  ----------
 |  width : int
 |      Number of blocks wide to make the grid.
 |  height : int
 |      Number of blocks high to make the grid.
...</span>
</pre>

  </div>

  <p>
    A monochrome grid isn't very exciting;
    we need a way to change blocks' colors,
    and some way to specify the colors we want.
    The most common way to do this is called "RGB",
    which defines colors according to how much red, green, and blue they contain.
    This is an additive color model:
    the color we see is the sum of the individual color values,
    each of which can range between 0 and 255.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Bytes and Colors</h3>
    <p>
      Color values go up to 255
      because computer memory is organized into 8-bit bytes,
      and 255 (or 11111111 in base 2) is the largest integer that can be represented in one byte.
      Storing each color component in a single byte is a good balance between
      being able to represent enough colors to fool the human eye
      and being able to store color values efficiently.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In RGB,
    black is (0, 0, 0), i.e., nothing of any color.
    White is the maximum value of all three colors, or (255, 255, 255).
    We can think of this color model is as a cube
    (<a href="#f:color_cube">Figure XXX</a>).:
    the three axes represent the primary colors,
    while secondary colors are combinations of maximum values,
    and each actual color is a coordinate in this cube.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:color_cube">
    <img src="pymedia/color_cube.png" alt="A Color Cube" />
    <figcaption>Figure XXX: A Color Cube</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The IPythonBlocks library includes a function called <code>show_color</code>
    that we can use to explore the RGB color cube:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from ipythonblocks import show_color
show_color(255, 0, 0)</span> <span class="comment"># all red</span>
FIXME: output
<span class="in">show_color(0, 255, 0)
show_color(0, 0, 255)</span>
FIXME: output
<span class="in">show_color(50, 100, 200)</span>
FIXME: output
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's change one corner of our grid from black to green:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">grid[0, 0] = (0, 255, 0)
grid.show()</span>
{% include guide-pyblocks/lib/blocks-grid-one-cell-green.html %}
</pre>

  <p>
    There's a lot going on in that assignment statement:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A color is one value,
      but we write it in three parts (red, green, and blue).
      To make it clear that we want those three parts grouped together,
      we put them in parentheses,
      as in <code>(0, 255, 0)</code>.
      This is called a <a href="glossary.html#tuple">tuple</a>;
      we'll see more of them as we go along.
    </li>
    <li>
      If we want to refer to a particular block in a grid,
      we use an <a href="glossary.html#index">index</a>
      (sometimes called a <a href="glossary.html#subscript">subscript</a>),
      just as we do when referring to a particular element of a matrix in mathematics such as <em>A<sub>i,j</sub></em>.
    </li>
    <li id="a:count-from-zero">
      The corner's coordinates are (0, 0), not (1, 1).
      Programming languages derived from C (a family that includes Python and Perl) all count from 0,
      for the same reason that color values run from 0 to 255
      instead of 1 to 256.
      Some other languages (notably Fortran, MATLAB, and R) count from 1.
      The latter is more natural&mdash;nobody says, "Zero, one, two, three, four," when counting their fingers&mdash;but
      we're stuck with the former for programming.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Finally,
    look closely at which pixel turned green.
    A Cartesian grid is typically drawn with the origin in the lower left,
    so that's what <code>ImageGrid</code> does.
    IPythonBlocks has another class called <code>BlockGrid</code>
    that uses the same coordinate scheme as tables and spreadsheets:
    the first index counts down the rows,
    while the second counts across the columns.
    To see this,
    let's import the class,
    create a grid of that type,
    and change the color of a cell
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="in">from ipythonblocks import BlockGrid
blocks = BlockGrid(6, 3)
blocks[1, 2] = (255, 0, 0)
blocks.show()</span>
{% include guide-pyblocks/lib/blocks-blockgrid.html %}
</pre>

  <p>
    Changing the color of one block isn't very useful, though:
    if we wanted to draw a picture that way,
    we'd have to write millions of assignment statements.
    What we need is a way to set the colors of many blocks at once,
    which is the subject of the next section.
  </p>
