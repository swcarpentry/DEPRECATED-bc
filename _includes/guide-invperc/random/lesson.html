  <h2>Randomness</h2>

  <p>
    Now that we have a grid,
    let's fill it with random numbers chosen uniformly from some range 1 to Z.
    We should check the science on this,
    as there was nothing in our original specification that said the values should be uniformly distributed,
    but once again we'll do something simple,
    make sure it's working,
    and then change it later.
    Our code looks like this:
  </p>

<pre>
<span class="highlight">from random import seed, randint</span>
assert N &gt; 0, "Grid size must be positive"
assert N%2 == 1, "Grid size must be odd"
<span class="highlight">assert Z &gt; 0, "Range must be positive"</span>
<span class="highlight">seed(S)</span>
grid = []
for x in range(N):
    grid.append([])
    for y in range(N):
        grid[-1].append(<span class="highlight">randint(1, Z)</span>)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The changes are pretty small:
    we import a couple of functions from a library,
    check that the upper bound on our random number range makes sense,
    initialize the random number generator,
    and then call <code>randint</code> to generate a random number
    each time we need one.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand these changes,
    let's step back and look at a small program
    that does nothing but generate a few seemingly random numbers:
  </p>

<pre>
from random import seed, randint
seed(4713983)
for i in range(5):
    print randint(1, 10),
<span class="out">7 2 6 6 5</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The first step is to import functions from the standard Python random number library
    called (unsurprisingly) <code>random</code>.
    We then initialize the sequence of "random" numbers we're going to generate&mdash;you'll
    see in a moment why there are quotes around the word "random".
    We can then call <code>randint</code>
    to produce the next random number in the sequence as many times as we want.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pseudo-random number generators like the one we're using have some important limitations,
    and it's important that you understand them before you use them in your programs.
    Consider this simple "random" number generator:
  </p>

<pre>
base = 17  # a prime
value = 4  # anything in 0..base-1
for i in range(20):
    value = (3 * value + 5) % base
    print value,
<span class="out">0 5 3 14 13 10 1 8 12 7 9 15 16 2 11 4 0 5 3 14</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    It depends on two values:
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>
      The <em>base</em>,
      which is a prime number,
      determines how many integers we'll get before the sequence starts to repeat itself.
      Computers can only represent a finite range of numbers,
      so sooner or later, any supposedly random sequence will start to repeat.
      Once they do, values will appear in exactly the same order they did before.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <em>seed</em> controls where the sequence starts.
      With a seed of 4,
      the sequence starts at the value 0.
      Changing the seed to 9 shifts the sequence over:
      we get the same numbers in the same order,
      but starting from a different place.
      We'll use this fact later one when it comes time to test our invasion percolation program.
    </li>

  </ol>

  <p>
    These numbers aren't actually very random at all.
    For example,
    did you notice that the number 6 never appeared anywhere in the sequence?
    Its absence would probably bias our statistics in ways that would be very hard to detect.
    But look at what happens if 6 <em>does</em> appear:
  </p>

<pre>
base = 17
value = 6
for i in range(20):
    value = (3 * value + 5) % base
    print value,
<span class="out">6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    3 times 6 plus 5 mod 17 is 6 again,
    and so our sequence gets stuck.
    How can we prove that this won't ever happen for an arbitrary seed in a random number generator?
    And how can we prove that something subtler won't go wrong?
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact,
    computers can't generate real random numbers.
    But if we're clever,
    they <em>can</em> generate numbers with many of the same statistical properties as the real thing.
    This is very hard to get right,
    so you should <em>never</em> try to build your own random number generator.
    Instead, you should always use a function from a good, well-tested library (like Python's).

    Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is,
    of course,
    in a state of sin.
    For,
    as has been pointed out several times,
    there is no such thing as a random number.
    There are only methods to produce random numbers,
    and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method.
