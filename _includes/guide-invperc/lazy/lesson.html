    If checking whether cells are candidates is the slowest step,
    let's try to reduce the number of times we have to do that.
    Instead of re-examining every cell in the grid each time we want to fill one,
    let's keep track of which cells are currently on the boundary in some kind of auxiliary data structure,
    then choose randomly from all the cells in that set that share the current lowest value.
    When we fill in a cell,
    we add its neighbors to the "pool" of neighbors (unless they're already there).
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the modified <code>fill_grid</code> function:
  </p>

<pre>
def fill_grid(grid):
    '''Fill an NxN grid until filled region hits boundary.'''

    x, y = grid.size/2, grid.size/2
    pool = set()
    pool.add((grid[x][y], x, y))
    num_filled = 0
    on_edge = False

    while not on_edge:
        x, y = get_next(pool)
        grid.mark_filled(x, y)
        num_filled += 1
        if (x == 0) or (x == grid.size-1) or (y == 0) or (y == grid.size-1):
            on_edge = True
        else:
            if x &gt; 0:
                make_candidate(grid, pool, x-1, y)
            if x &lt; grid.size-1:
                make_candidate(grid, pool, x+1, y)
            if y &gt; 0:
                make_candidate(grid, pool, x,   y-1)
            if y &lt; grid.size-1:
                make_candidate(grid, pool, x,   y+1)

    return num_filled
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This function creates a set called <code>pool</code>
    that keeps track of the cells currently on the edge of the filled region.
    Each loop iteration gets the next cell out of this pool,
    fills it in,
    and (potentially) adds its neighbors to the set.
  </p>

  <p>
    This function is 21 lines long,
    compared to 15 for our original <code>fill_grid</code> function,
    but four of those six lines are the calls to <code>make_candidate</code>,
    which adds a neighbor to the pool if it isn't already there.
    Let's have a look at <code>get_next</code> and <code>make_candidate</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
def get_next(pool):
    '''Take a cell randomly from the equal-valued front section.'''

    temp = list(pool)
    temp.sort()
    v = temp[0][0]
    i = 1
    while (i &lt; len(temp)) and (temp[i][0] == v):
        i += 1
    i = random.randint(0, i-1)
    v, x, y = temp[i]
    pool.discard((v, x, y))
    return x, y

def make_candidate(grid, pool, x, y):
    '''Ensure that (x, y, v) is a candidate.'''

    v = grid_get(grid, x, y)
    if v == FILLED:
        return
    pool.add((v, x, y))
</pre>

  <p>
    This is definitely more complicated that what we started with:
    we now have to keep a second data structure (the pool) up to date,
    and in sync with the grid.
    But look at the payoff:
  </p>

  <table class="outlined">
    <tr> <td></td> <td>11</td> <td>21</td> <td>31</td> <td>41</td> <td>51</td> <td>61</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>list&nbsp;of&nbsp;lists</td> <td>0.000333</td> <td>0.025667</td> <td>0.088833</td> <td>0.227167</td> <td>0.455000</td> <td>1.362667</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>set&nbsp;pool</td> <td>0.000050</td> <td>0.003000</td> <td>0.009100</td> <td>0.016130</td> <td>0.012000</td> <td>0.027050</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>ratio</td> <td>6.66</td> <td>8.56</td> <td>9.76</td> <td>14.1</td> <td>37.9</td> <td>50.4</td> </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    Now <em>that</em> is a speedup.
    If we assume that we fill about N<sup>1.5</sup> cells in an N&times;N grid,
    the running time of our algorithm is about N<sup>1.5</sup> instead of N<sup>3.5</sup>,
    because we only need to inspect four new cells in every iteration
    instead of checking all N<sup>2</sup> each time.
    As a result, the bigger our grids get, the bigger our savings are.
