  <p>
    The term "software engineering" was first used at a NATO conference in 1968,
    and was chosen to provoke discussion about how we ought to build large, complex software systems.
    People have argued ever since about what the term actually means,
    and whether "engineering" is the right model to aspire to.
    For example, should we be able to sue programmers for making flaky software
    the same way that we can sue engineers for designing faulty dams and bridges?
    On the one hand, quality would probably improve.
    On the other,
    mathematical techniques for analyzing programs are still quite limited
    despite fifty years of hard work,
    and it's hardly fair to require someone to meet standards that aren't yet achievable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Either way,
    most people's definition of "software engineering" includes project management,
    which is what this final section will focus on.
    For our purposes, the difference between software carpentry and software engineering
    is the difference between putting up some drywall and building a bridge.
    A reasonably skilled amateur can do the first in a few hours or a couple of days
    with a little bit of planning, a couple of sketches, and a few hand tools.
    The second is more involved:
    it requires a team of people (some of them specialists), bigger tools,
    and a lot more planning and monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    The good news is, studies show that most scientists and engineers work at the carpentry end of the scale.
    The bad news is,
    many people don't recognize when the techniques that have served them well for years are no longer adequate,
    which is one of the reasons many large software projects (in industry as well as in research)
    come in late or over budget,
    or wind up failing completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a quick rule of thumb,
    if a dozen people are involved in your project,
    or if the work is going to take more than a dozen weeks,
    then you're doing engineering.
    And like it or not,
    you're going to have to think about how you plan, scope, and monitor your work.
    The only question is whether you're going to do this at the start of the project,
    or after everything has come crashing down around you.

    <h3>Agile Development</h3>

    <p>
      The term "agile" was coined in 2001 to describe
      a "bottom-up" style of software project management
      based on short iterations and frequent feedback from both developers and customers.
      Agile development practices are actually as old as programming itself,
      but they came into their own with the rise of the World Wide Web.
      First, the web made it possible to "release" software weekly, daily, or even hourly
      since updating a server is a lot faster (and a lot less expensive)
      than shipping CDs to thousands of people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, during the 1990s and early 2000s it seemed as if
      the things the web could do
      and how best to make it do those things
      were changing almost daily.
      Multi-year development plans didn't make a lot of sense
      when everything they depended on would be obsolete by the time work started,
      much less by the time it finished.
      Third, the growth of the web coincided with the growth of open source software.
      People couldn't help noticing that most open source projects didn't have long-range plans,
      but nevertheless produced high-quality software faster than many closed-source commercial projects.
      While open source isn't necessarily agile,
      and agile development projects usually aren't open source,
      there are a lot of similarities.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what is agile software development?
      At its heart,
      it is any software development method that relies on continuous or nearly continuous feedback
      on short timescales
      (<a href="#f:agile_cycles">Figure 17</a>).
      Agile developers work in short steps that are typically no more than two weeks long,
      and often as short as a single day.
      In each iteration,
      the team decides what to build next,
      designs it,
      builds it,
      tests it,
      and delivers it.
      Feedback loops at several scales help them get this right
      and do it better next time.
    </p>

    <figure id="f:agile_cycles">
      <img src="dev/agile_cycles.png" alt="Agile Feedback Loops" />
      <figcaption>Figure 17: Agile Feedback Loops</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The iteration itself is the primary feedback loop.
      Users often don't know what they want until they see it,
      so short cycles are a way to avoid spending too much time building what turns out to be the wrong thing.
      This "exploratory" philosophy is why many people think that agile is a good way to develop research software.
      Most researchers are their own users,
      and often can't know what they should write next until they've seen the output of the current version of the program,
      so long-term planning often isn't possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Short iterations help improve efficiency in two other ways as well.
      First, most people can keep track of what they're doing for a few days at a time
      without elaborate time charts,
      so short cycles allow them to spend proportionally less time coordinating with one another.
      Second, finding bugs becomes easier:
      instead of looking through weeks' or months' worth of software to find out where the problem is,
      developers usually only have to look at what's been written in the last few days.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical working day starts with a <a href="glossary.html#stand-up-meeting">stand-up meeting</a>
      where everyone in the team reports what they did the day before,
      what they're planning to do that day, and what's blocking them (if anything).
      (It's called a "stand-up" meeting because it is held standing up,
      which encourages people to be brief.)
      For example, suppose Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy are working on some new mind control software.
      Wolfman's report might be:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Yesterday:
        fixed the bug that was making the message file reader crash on accented characters,
        and added code to the web page generator to display accented characters properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Today:
        will get message file reader to recognize links to images and load those images.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blockers:
        what should the message file reader do if the image is on the web instead of local?
        Should it try to read it, or is that a security hole?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Stand-up meetings are a feedback loop.
      Each day,
      the team gets feedback on the progress they're making,
      whether they're still on track to meet the iteration's goals,
      whether the technical decisions they're making are paying off,
      and so on.
      The key to making this work is that
      each task is either done or not done:
      "80% done" and "almost finished" aren't allowed.
      This rule encourages people to break large tasks into pieces
      that can be completed in a day or less
      so that they'll have something substantial to report every morning.
      This in turn encourages them to think ahead a little more,
      and helps make their estimation more accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the stand-up meeting is over, everyone gets back to work.
      In many agile teams, this means sitting with a partner and doing
      <a href="glossary.html#pair-programming">pair programming</a>.
      Two people work together at one machine:
      the "driver" does the typing,
      the "navigator" watches and comments,
      and every hour or so, the two switch roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pair programming is beneficial for several reasons.
      First, the navigator will often notice mistakes in the driver's code,
      or remember design decisions that the driver is too busy typing to recall.
      This is the tightest of the feedback loops that make agile work,
      since feedback is nearly continuous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, pair programming spreads knowledge around:
      every piece of code has been seen by at least two people,
      which increases the <a href="glossary.html#bus-factor">bus factor</a> of the project.
      Pairing also helps people pick up new skills:
      if you have just seen someone do something with two clicks,
      you will probably do it that way when it's your turn to drive,
      rather than spending two minutes doing it the way you always have.
      And finally,
      most people are less likely to check Facebook every five minutes
      if someone else is working with them...
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>On the Other Hand...</h3>

      <p>
        Pairing improves overall productivity,
        but in many research settings
        everyone has a problem of their own to work on,
        so it may not be practical.
        People also often find it disruptive or awkward:
        having several conversations going on at once makes for a noisy lab,
        and desks often aren't built for two people to share comfortably.
      </p>

      <p>
        For these reasons,
        many groups reserve pairing for:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          bringing a new person up to speed
          (which happens a lot faster if they're paired with
          a more experienced team member for a few days);
        </li>
        <li>
          tackling hard bugs
          (where "hard" means "anything one person can't figure out in an hour");
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          once or twice a week,
          just to stay in practice.
        </li>
      </ol>

    </div>

    <p>
      As well as pair programming,
      most agile teams rely on
      <a href="quality.html#s:tdd">test-driven development</a>
      and <a href="quality.html#a:ci">continuous integration</a>,
      both of which we discussed in the lesson on <a href="quality.html">software quality</a>.
      Together, the two practices give developers more feedback:
      TDD lets them see how their design decisions are going to play out
      before they're committed to a particular implementation,
      while continuous integration tells them (and everyone else) when they've forgotten something,
      or broken something that was working a moment ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is agile development right for you?
      As a rough guide, it works best when:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Requirements are constantly changing,
        i.e.,
        long-range planning isn't possible anyway.
        This is often the case for scientific research, particularly at the small scale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers and users can communicate continuously,
        or at worst daily or weekly.
        Again,
        this is normal for small-scale research, where developers and users are the same people.
      </li>
      <li>
        The team is small,
        so that everyone can take part in a single stand-up meeting.
        This is usually also true,
        though getting everyone to show up for a morning meeting is a challenge in many labs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Team members are disciplined enough not to use "agile" as an excuse for cowboy coding.
      </li>
      <li>
        People actually <em>like</em> being empowered.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The last two points are the most important.
      Even professional developers don't like writing plans before they code,
      or documentation when they're done.
      Coincidentally, agile doesn't require them to do much of either.
      It's therefore all too common for developers to say "we're agile"
      when what they mean is "we're not going to bother doing anything we don't want to".
      Agile development actually requires <em>more</em> discipline,
      not less,
      just as improvising well requires even more musical talent than playing a score exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
      As for the second point,
      many people don't like making decisions:
      after two decades of schooling,
      they want to be told what the assignment is
      and exactly what they have to do to get an 'A'.
      Many become quite defensive when told that
      figuring out what to do is now part of their job,
      but that's as essential to agile development as it is to scientific research.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h3>Sturdy Development</h3>

    <p>
      Agile isn't the only way to develop software.
      Before the term was invented,
      the major alternative didn't have a name:
      it was just how big software engineering projects were run.
      Today,
      it's usually called "traditional" or "waterfall" development,
      though fans of agile often call it "big design up front" or something less kind.
    </p>

    <p>
      We prefer the label "sturdy" because it puts a more positive spin on things.
      While agile is all about reacting quickly and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise,
      sturdy emphasizes predictability,
      particularly on large, long-lived projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start by looking at what sturdy development <em>isn't</em>.
      A <a href="glossary.html#waterfall-development">waterfall model</a> of software development
      divides development into distinct stages,
      with information flowing from one stage to the next like water falling down a hill
      (<a href="#f:waterfall_model">Figure 18</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:waterfall_model">
      <img src="dev/waterfall_model.png" alt="Waterfall Model" />
      <figcaption>Figure 18: Waterfall Model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Even in 1970,
      when this model was first given a name,
      people knew it didn't work.
      Nobody has 20/20 foresight:
      requirements are always discovered or changed as software is designed,
      while designs are re-done based on what's learned during implementation,
      implementations are modified as testing finds problems,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      But that doesn't mean that up-front planning and design are pointless.
      Thirty-five years ago,
      Barry Boehm and others discovered that the later a bug is found,
      the more expensive fixing it is.
      What's more, the cost curve is exponential:
      as we move from requirements to design to implementation to testing to deployment,
      the cost of fixing a problem increases by a factor of 3 to 5 at each stage,
      and those increases multiply
      (<a href="#f:boehm_curve">Figure 19</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:boehm_curve">
      <img src="dev/boehm_curve.png" alt="Boehm Curve" />
      <figcaption>Figure 19: Boehm Curve</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The obvious implication is that time invested in up-front design
      can pay off many-fold if it prevents mistakes being made in the first place.
      It isn't always possible to do&mdash;people may not know what they want
      until they see something running,
      or tools may change so quickly that anything we design today
      will be obsolete by the time it's implemented&mdash;but
      very few programmers have ever said,
      "I wish I'd spent <em>less</em> time thinking about this before I started coding."
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="#f:sturdy_lifecycle">Figure 20</a> shows
      what a year-long sturdy development lifecycle looks like in practice.
      The first step in each cycle is to gather requirements,
      i.e.,
      to figure out what the software is supposed to do.
      This is the <a href="glossary.html#product-manager">product manager</a>'s job;
      while the developers are working on version 4,
      she talks to the customers about what they want version 5 to do.
    </p>

    <figure id="f:sturdy_lifecycle">
      <img src="dev/sturdy_lifecycle.png" alt="Sturdy Lifecycle" />
      <figcaption>Figure 20: Sturdy Lifecycle</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Crucially,
      she should never ask them what features they want in the software&mdash;that's
      up to her to figure out.
      Instead,
      she should ask,
      "What does it do now that you don't like?" and,
      "What can't you do that you'd like to be able to?"
      She collates these needs and figures out how the software should be changed to satisfy them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Good requirements are as unambiguous as a legal contract.
      "The system will reformat data files as they are submitted" isn't enough;
      instead, the requirements should read:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Only users who have logged in by providing a valid user name and password can upload files.</li>
      <li>The system allows users to upload files via a secure web form.</li>
      <li>The system accepts files up to 16MB long.</li>
      <li>The system accepts files in PDB and RJCS-1 format.</li>
      <li>The system converts files to RJCS-2 format before storing them.</li>
      <li>The system displays an error message page if an uploaded file cannot be parsed, but takes no other action.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="continue">
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next step is <a href="glossary.html#analysis-and-estimation">analysis and estimation</a>.
      Each team member is responsible for analyzing and estimating one or more features.
      She has to come up with a plausible rough design, and estimate how long it will take to implement.
      In fact,
      wherever possible she should come up with <em>two</em> such plans:
      one for doing the whole feature,
      and one that obeys the 80/20 rule by providing part of what's been asked for with much less effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Analysis and estimation presupposes some sort of overall design for the system as a whole.
      For example,
      it doesn't make sense to say,
      "We'll create a plugin to handle communication with the new orbiting mind control laser,"
      unless the application has some sort of plugin system.
      If it doesn't,
      creating one is a task in its own right (probably a large one).
    </p>

    <p>
      Once everything has been estimated,
      it's time to prioritize,
      because there's always more to do than there is time to do it.
      The easiest way to do this for medium-sized projects and teams is to draw a 3&times;3 grid on a whiteboard.
      One axis is "effort", broken down into "small", "medium", and "large".
      The other is "importance", broken down into "low", "medium", and "high".
      Each feature's name is put on a sticky note,
      and each sticky note goes into one of the nine boxes on the grid
      (<a href="#f:schedule_grid">Figure 21</a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="f:schedule_grid">
      <img src="dev/schedule_grid.png" alt="Schedule Grid" />
      <figcaption>Figure 21: Schedule Grid</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Once this has been done,
      it's easy to draw a diagonal line on the grid and throw away everything below it&mdash;after all,
      anything that's rated "high effort" but "low importance" isn't worth doing.
      Conversely,
      anything that's high importance and low effort definitely belongs in the plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then there are the diagonal boxes.
      Should the team try to do one important, high-effort feature,
      or tackle a handful of things that are less important but easier?
      Whatever they choose,
      it's critical that they don't shave their time estimates to make things fit,
      and that the <a href="glossary.html#project-manager">project manager</a> doesn't either.
      The project manager is responsible for making sure things get built on time and to spec;
      if the product manager owns the feature list,
      the project manager owns the schedule
      (and yes, the similarity in those job titles is confusing).
      If the project manager starts shaving or squeezing estimates,
      developers will start padding them in self-defense.
      In response,
      the project manager will cut them back even more,
      until all the numbers are just so much science fiction.
      Lazy or timid developers can betray this trust by over-estimating,
      but even minimal time tracking will catch that sooner rather than later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the features have been picked,
      it's the project manager's job to assemble them into a schedule showing who's going to do what when.
      The real purpose of this schedule is to help the team figure how far behind they are
      so that they can start cutting corners early on.
      A common way to do this is to keep a <a href="glossary.html#burn-down-chart">burn-down chart</a>,
      which compares the plan with reality on a day-by-day or week-by-week basis.
      If and when a gap opens up,
      the team can either figure out when they're actually going to be done,
      and move the delivery date back,
      or go back to the 3&times;3 grid
      to figure out what they can drop or scale back to meet the current deadline.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why it's useful to have people estimate both the full feature and an 80/20 version.
      If and when time is running short,
      it may be possible to switch tracks and deliver most of the value with much less effort.
      The right time to think about this is the start of the project,
      when people are rested and relatively relaxed,
      not six weeks before a major conference deadline when tempers are already frayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for any of this to work,
      developers have to be fairly good at estimating how long things will take.
      That comes from experience,
      but also from careful record keeping.
      Just as runners and swimmers keep track of their times for doing their favorite distances,
      good developers keep track of how long it takes to build X or fix Y
      so that they'll be able to do a better job of estimating how long the next one will take.
      (In fact,
      whether or not a developer keeps track of their stats
      is a good way to tell how serious they are about their craft in an interview&mdash;something
      that would-be developers should keep in mind.)
    </p>

    <p>
       Going back to <a href="#f:sturdy_lifecycle">Figure 20</a>,
       you may have noticed that design overlaps estimation,
       and coding overlaps design.
       This is deliberate:
       it's usually impossible to figure out how to do something without writing some throwaway code.
       You may also have noticed that testing starts just as soon as development.
       This is critical to the project's success:
       if it is left until development is mostly done,
       it will inevitably be shortchanged.
       The consequences are usually disastrous,
       not least for the team's morale.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact,
      the members of the team responsible for testing
      should be involved in the analysis and estimation phase as well.
      They should review every part of the plan
      to ensure that what the developer is planning to is testable.
      Anything that isn't should be sent back to the drawing board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Delivery starts at the same time as development.
      Daily or weekly,
      the team should "deliver" the software by creating and testing installers,
      deploying it on a handful of servers,
      burning ROMs and putting them into test rigs in the lab,
      or whatever it is they're going to do when the iteration is finished.
      Packaging and delivery are often just as complex as the software itself,
      and leaving it until the last moment will once again usually have disastrous consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally,
      notice that development stops well before the target delivery date.
      Ideally,
      developers should stop adding new code to the project about two thirds of the way through the development cycle
      so that they can spend the remaining third of the time fixing the problems that testing turns up.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two-thirds point isn't chosen at random.
      In all too many projects,
      that's when the high hopes that the team started with bump into the reality of over-optimistic scheduling,
      poor progress monitoring,
      and design decisions that weren't reviewed carefully
      (or at all).
      The common reaction is to ask the team to buckle down and put in extra hours.
      This almost always makes things worse:
      as study after study has shown,
      human beings are only capable of about 40 hours of productive intellectual work per week.
      Anything more,
      and the mistakes they make because of fatigue outweigh the extra time they're putting in,
      so that the project actually slows down.

      <h3>Science Says...</h3>

      <p>
        Evan Robinson's excellent article "<a href="http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">Why Crunch Mode Doesn't Work</a>"
        summarizes the science behind this.
        Continuous work reduces cognitive function 25% for every 24 hours,
        which means that after two all nighters,
        a person's IQ is that of someone legally incompetent to care for themselves.
        The kicker is that,
        as with other forms of impairment,
        people don't realize they're affected:
        they believe they're still functioning properly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      So, is sturdy development right for you?
      As a rough guide,
      you should use it when:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Requirements are relatively fixed,
        or the team has enough experience in the problem domain to make estimation and planning possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The team is large.
        If some team members aren't ever going to meet others,
        frequent course changes probably aren't going to be possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your customer insists on knowing well in advance exactly what you're going to deliver and when.
        Avionics software and control systems for nuclear power plants are extreme examples,
        but there are many other situations in which stakeholders genuinely do need to know
        exactly what's going to be ready to use this time next year.
      </li>
    </ol>

  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>More Alike Than Different</h3>

    <p>
      In practice,
      agile and sturdy development are more alike than their most passionate advocates like to pretend.
      Sturdy teams often use continuous integration systems and test-driven development,
      while agile projects often have an "iteration zero"
      in which they analyze architectural options and do large-scale design.
    </p>

    <p>
      One key practice the two methods share is
      the use of <a href="glossary.html#ticketing">ticketing</a> to keep track of work.
      Ticketing tools are often called <a href="glossary.html#bug-tracking">bug-tracking systems</a>,
      since they are often used to keep track of bugs that need to be fixed,
      but well-organized teams use them as a shared to-do list to manage all kinds of tasks.
      Every task is recorded as a separate ticket,
      each of which has a unique number,
      a one-line summary,
      and a longer description that may include screenshots, error messages, and so on.
      It also has some state,
      such as "open", "in progress", "closed", or "rejected",
      and keeps track of who created it and when,
      and who it's assigned to.
      A typical ticket might look like this:
    </p>

<pre>ID: 1278
Created-By: mummy
Owned-By: wolfman
State: assigned
Summary: Message file reader crashes on accented characters
Description:
1. Create a text file called 'accent.msg' containing the message
   "You vill dream of p&uuml;mpernickel" (with an umlaut over the 'u').

2. Run the program with 'python mindcontrol.py --all --message accent.msg'.

Program crashes with the message "No encoding for [] on line 1 of 'accent.msg'".
([] shows where a solid black box appears in the output instead of a printable
character.)</pre>

    <p>
      When Wolfman checks in the code that fixes this bug,
      and the tests for that fix,
      he changes the ticket's state from "in progress" to "closed".
      If someone later discovers that his fix doesn't actually work,
      they can change the state from "closed" to "open"
      (meaning "we need to decide who's going to work on this")
      or back to "in progress"
      (meaning "a particular person is now responsible for working on this").
      More sophisticated ticketing systems allow people to record dependencies between tickets
      (such as "work can't start on this one until #917 is closed"),
      to estimate how long work will take,
      to record how long work actually took,
      and so on.
      They also limit who can change the states of tickets or assign them to particular people,
      which is one way to implement particular workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another key practice in sturdy development is code review.
      As we discuss <a href="#a:code-review">later</a>,
      empirical studies have found that this is the single most cost-effective way to find bugs.
      It also helps spread understanding in teams that don't use pair programming
      (which most don't).
    </p>

    <p>
      Code can be reviewed before it's committed to version control or after.
      Most teams prefer pre-commit reviews for two reasons.
      First,
      they prevent mistakes getting into the repository in the first place,
      which is better than putting them there and then taking them out.
      Second,
      if the team agrees that nothing gets committed until it has been reviewed,
      it's much more likely that reviews will actually get done.
      If changes can be committed,
      then reviewed later,
      that "later" may slip and slip and never come at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can the Mummy review Frankenstein's code <em>before</em> Frankenstein checks it in?
      Some teams solve this problem by creating one branch per developer,
      or per feature.
      The people working in that branch can check in any time,
      but review has to happen before code can be merged with the main line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another common approach is for developers to create a <a href="glossary.html#patch">patch</a>
      before committing their work to version control.
      A patch is just a list of the differences between two sets of files,
      such as two different versions of the source code for a program.
      Developers can store their patches in the version control system,
      attach them to tickets,
      or submit them to a code review management tool like ReviewBoard.
      Someone else can then comment on the patch,
      which the author can then revise.
      In large open source projects like Python and Firefox,
      it's common for patches to be reviewed and updated a dozen times or more
      before finally being committed to version control.
      Newcomers often find this frustrating,
      but experience shows that as projects become larger,
      "measure twice, cut once" pays off.

    <h3>The Evidence</h3>

    <p>
      We've made a lot of claims in this section about
      how development should be done.
      The time has come to look at the evidence that backs them up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we begin,
      though,
      it's important to realize
      most programmers know as little about research in their field
      as doctors knew about science a hundred years ago.
      Someone doing a degree in geology or biochemistry
      probably does at least one laboratory experiment a week,
      but if that same person does a computer science degree,
      they will probably only collect and analyze data once or twice
      during four years.
      Most programmers therefore don't have a hands-on appreciation for
      what evidence looks like and how to assess it;
      as a result,
      many think that a couple of pints,
      a loud voice,
      and a "just so" story about a startup in Silicon Valley
      constitute proof of whatever they want to prove.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news is, things are finally changing.
      While data on real programmers and real software
      were a rarity well into the 1990s,
      papers published today that describe new tools or new working practices
      routinely report results from some kind of empirical study.
      Many of these studies are still smaller in scale than we'd like,
      or methodologically naive,
      but standards are improving rapidly.
    </p>

    <p id="a:code-review">
      Here's one classic result.
      In the mid-1970s,
      Michael Fagan shows that
      reading code carefully is the most cost-effective way to find bugs&mdash;it
      can find 60-90% of all the bugs in a piece of software before it's run for the first time.
      Thirty years later,
      Cohen and others refined this result by looking at data collected by a web-based code review tool at Cisco.
      They found that almost all of the value of code reviews came from the first reviewer,
      and the first hour they were reviewing code.
      Basically,
      extra reviewers beyond the first don't find enough bugs to make their reviews cost-effective,
      and if someone spends more than an hour reading code,
      they become fatigued and stop finding anything except trivial formatting errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In light of this,
      it's not surprising that code review has become a common practice in most open source projects:
      given the freedom to work any way they want,
      most top-notch developers have discovered for themselves that
      having someone else look over a piece of code before it's committed to version control
      produces working code in less time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getting scientists to adopt code reviews has proven surprisingly difficult,
      especially considering that peer review of publications is a normal part of scientific life.
      The main reason seems to be that
      most pieces of small-scale scientific are written by one person for themselves,
      and it's hard to get people to review code that they're not going to use themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's another interesting result.
      After Windows Vista shipped,
      several researchers threw some machine learning algorithms at
      the data Microsoft had collected during its construction.
      They had a record of every change made to the software,
      every meeting ever scheduled,
      where developers sat,
      what tests they had run,
      what they'd said via instant messaging,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things they looked at was whether
      developers who sat together
      produced better code
      (i.e., fewer bugs)
      than developers who were geographically distributed.
      Much to their surprise,
      they found that physical geography was a weak predictor of software quality.
      What correlated much more strongly was
      how far apart developers were in the company's organization chart.
      Basically,
      the higher you had to go in the org chart to find a common boss
      who could set direction and resolve disputes,
      the more bugs there would be in the software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are a few other interesting results:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        Is there anything we can measure in software
        that's bettr at predicting either the number of bugs
        or the effort required to build it
        than simply counting the number of lines of code?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        No:
        every sophisticated measure we have
        correlates closely with the simplest.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Do more frequent releases improve software quality?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Yes,
        but they also change the nature of the bugs that do occur.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Are some programmers really 40 times better than others?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Probably not:
        studies that seem to show this
        were often comparing the best to the worst,
        which exaggerates the effect.
        What does seem true is the claim that
        any given programmer produces roughly the same number of lines of code per day,
        regardless of what language she is working in.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Does knowledge and use of design patterns improve the quality of code?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Yes,
        and there is a causative relationship:
        it isn't simply the case that
        good developers are more likely to know about patterns.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Are women intrinsically less likely to be interested in programming,
        or are social forces largely responsible for the seven-to-one gender disparity
        among programmers?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Social forces (some subtle, some not) are overwhelmingly responsible.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Are code modules with clear "owners"
        less likely to contain errors than
        code modules authored by many people?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Yes,
        but keep the <a href="glossary.html#bus-factor">bus factor</a> in mind:
        a module with one or a few owners,
        also has higher risk of being orphaned in the long run.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Are some programming languages harder to learn than others?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Almost certainly:
        in fact,
        it appears as though Perl is as hard to learn as
        a language whose syntax has been "designed" by a random number generator.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Even when people do know about research,
      they are often to change what they do
      to reflect what we know
      (just as they are with smoking).
      One example is test-driven development.
      Many programmers believe quite strongly that this is the "right" way to program,
      and that it leads to better code in less time.
      However, a meta-analysis of over thirty studies found no consistent effect:
      some of the studies reported benefits,
      some found that it made things worse,
      and some were inconclusive.
      One clear finding, though,
      was that the better the study,
      the weaker the signal.
      This result may be disappointing to some people (it certainly was to me),
      but progress sometimes is.
      And even if these studies are wrong,
      figuring out why,
      and doing better studies,
      will advance our understanding.

      Books like Glass's
      <a href="bib.html#glass-facts-fallacies"><cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a>
      and the collection
      <a href="bib.html#oram-wilson-making-software"><cite>Making Software</cite></a>
      are good summaries of what we actually know and why we belive it's true.
      If you're going to spend any significant time programming
      (or arguing with programmers)
      it's easier than ever to find out
      what the evidence actually is.
      And if we want people to pay attention to our science,
      we have an obligation to base our opinions on theirs.
