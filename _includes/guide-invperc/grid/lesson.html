    Let's start by looking at
    how to represent a two-dimensional grid in Python.
    By "two-dimensional",
    we mean something that's indexed by X and Y coordinates.
    Our grid is discrete:
    we need to store values for locations (1, 1), (1, 2), and so on,
    but not locations like (1.512, 7.243).

    <h3>Why Not Use a NumPy Array?</h3>

    <p>
      Because (a) we want to get some more practice manipulating lists
      and dealing with aliasing,
      and (b) because we need to leave something for learners to do as challenges.
    </p>

  <p>
    Each cell in the grid stores a single random value
    representing the permeability of the rock.
    We also need a way to mark cells that have been filled with pollutant.
    Once a cell has been filled,
    we don't care about its value any longer,
    so we can use any number that isn't going to appear in the grid otherwise
    as a marker to show which cells have been filled.
    For now,
    we'll use -1.

    <h3>Overloading Meaning</h3>

    <p>
      Note that this means we're using integers in two ways.
      The first is as actual data values;
      the second is as flags to represent the state of a cell.
      This is simple to do,
      but if we ever get data values that happen to contain
      the numbers that we're using to mark filled cells,
      our program will misinterpret them.
      Bugs like this can be very hard to track down.
    </p>

  <p>
    Before we go any further,
    we also have to make some decisions about the shapes of our grids.
    First,
    do grids always have to be square, i.e., N&times;N,
    or can we have rectangular grids whose X and Y sizes are different?
    Second,
    do grids always have to be odd-sized,
    so that there's a unique center square for us to fill at the start,
    or can we have a grid that is even in size along one or both axes?
  </p>

  <p>
    The real question is,
    how general should we make the first version of this program&mdash;indeed,
    of <em>any</em> program?
    Some people say, "Don't build it until you need it,"
    while others say, "A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought."
    Both sayings are true,
    but as in any other intellectually demanding field,
    knowing what rules to apply when comes with experience,
    and the only way to get experience is to work through many examples
    (and make a few mistakes).
    Again,
    let's do the simple thing for now,
    and assume that grids are always square and odd-sized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, how are we going to store the grid?
    One way is to use a <a href="python.html#g:nested-list">nested list</a>.
    This lets us use double subscripts to refer to elements,
    which is really what we mean by "two dimensional".
    Here's a piece of code that builds a grid of 1's as a list of lists;
    we'll come back later and show how to fill those cells with random values instead:
  </p>

<pre>
# Create an NxN grid of random integers in 1..Z.
assert N &gt; 0, "Grid size must be positive"
assert N%2 == 1, "Grid size must be odd"
grid = []
for x in range(N):
    grid.append([])
    for y in range(N):
        grid[-1].append(1) # FIXME: need a random value
</pre>

  <p>
    The first thing we do is check that the grid size <code>N</code> is a sensible value.
    We then assign an empty list to the variable <code>grid</code>.
    The first time through the outer loop,
    we append a new empty list to the outer list.
    Each pass through the inner loop,
    we append the value 1 to that inner list
    (<a href="#f:building_grid">Figure 3</a>).
    We go back through the outer loop to append another sub-list,
    which we grow by adding more 1's,
    and so on until we get the grid that we wanted.

    <h3>FIXME</h3>

    <p>
      At any point when writing a program,
      there may be half a dozen things that need to be done next.
      The problem is,
      we can only write one at a time.
      It's therefore a common practice to add comments to the code
      to remind ourselves of things we need to come back and fill in (or tidy up) later.
      It's equally common to start such comments with a word like "FIXME" or "TODO"
      to make them easier to find with tools like <a href="shell.html#s:find"><code>grep</code></a>.
