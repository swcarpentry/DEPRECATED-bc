  <p>
    Now that it's easy to write tests,
    we can start worrying about our program's performance.
    When people use that phrase,
    they almost always mean the program's speed.
    In fact,
    speed is why computers were invented:
    until networks and fancy graphics came along,
    the whole reason computers existed was
    to do in minutes or hours what would take human beings weeks or years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scientists usually want programs to go faster for three reasons.
    First, they want a solution to a single large problem,
    such as, "What's the lift of this wing?"
    Second, they have many problems to solve,
    and need answers to all of them&mdash;a typical example is,
    "Compare this DNA sequences to every one in the database and tell me what the closest matches are."
    Finally, scientists may have a deadline and a fixed set of resources
    and want to solve as big a problem as possible within the constraints.
    Weather prediction falls into this category:
    given more computing power,
    scientists use more accurate (and more computationally demanding) models,
    rather than solving the old models faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before trying to make a program go faster,
    there are two questions we should always ask ourselves.
    First, does our program actually need to go faster?
    If we only use it once a day,
    and it only takes a minute to run,
    speeding it up by a factor of 10 is probably not worth
    a week of our time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Second, is our program correct?
    There's no point making a buggy program faster:
    more wrong answers per unit time doesn't move science forward
    (although it may help us track down a bug).
    Just as importantly,
    almost everything we do to make programs faster also makes them more complicated,
    and therefore harder to debug.
    If our starting point is correct,
    we can use its output to check the output of our optimized version.
    If it isn't, we've probably made our life more difficult.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's go back to invasion percolation.
    To find out how fast our program is,
    let's add a few lines to the program's main body:
  </p>

<pre>
if __name__ == '__main__':

    ...get simulation parameters from command-line arguments...

    # Run simulation.
<span class="highlight">    start_time = time.time()</span>
    random.seed(random_seed)
    grid = create_random_grid(grid_size, value_range)
    mark_filled(grid, grid_size/2, grid_size/2)
    num_filled = fill_grid(grid) + 1
<span class="highlight">    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time</span>
<span class="highlight">    print 'program=%s size=%d range=%d seed=%d filled=%d time=%f' % \</span>
<span class="highlight">          (sys.argv[0], grid_size, value_range, random_seed, num_filled, elapsed_time)</span>
    if graphics:
        show_grid(grid)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The first new line records the time when the program starts running.
    The other new lines use that to calculate how long the simulation took,
    and then display the program's parameters and running time.
  </p>

  <p>
    We need to make one more change
    before we start running lots of simulation.
    We were seeding the random number generator using the computer's clock time:
  </p>

<pre>
    start_time = time.time()
    ...
    random_seed = int(start_time)
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    But what if a simulation runs very quickly?
    <code>time.time()</code> returns a floating point number;
    <code>int</code> truncates this by throwing away the fractional part,
    so if our simulation runs in less than a second,
    two (or more) might wind up with the same seed,
    which in turn will mean they have the same "random" values in their grids.
    (This isn't a theoretical problem&mdash;we actually tripped over it while writing this lesson.)
  </p>

  <p>
    One way to fix this is to to shift those numbers up.
    For now let's guess that every simulation will take at least a tenth of a millisecond to run,
    so we'll multiply the start time by ten thousand,
    then truncate it so that it is less than a million:
  </p>

<pre>
RAND_SCALE = 10000    # Try to make sure random seeds are distinct.
RAND_RANGE = 1000000  # Range of random seeds.
...
    random_seed = int(start_time * RAND_SCALE) % RAND_RANGE
</pre>

  <p>
    The final step is to write a shell script that runs the program multiple times
    for various grid sizes:
  </p>

<pre>
for size in {11..81..10}
do
  for counter in {1..20}
  do
    python invperc.py -g -n $size -v 100
  done
done
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    (We could equally well have added a few more lines to the program itself
    to run a specified number of simulations
    instead of just one.)
    If we average the 20 values for each grid size, we get the following:
  </p>

  <table class="outlined">
    <tr> <td></td> <td>11</td> <td>21</td> <td>31</td> <td>41</td> <td>51</td> <td>61</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>cells&nbsp;filled</td> <td>16.60</td> <td>45.75</td> <td>95.85</td> <td>157.90</td> <td>270.50</td> <td>305.75</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>time&nbsp;taken</td> <td>0.003971</td> <td>0.035381</td> <td>0.155885</td> <td>0.444160</td> <td>1.157350</td> <td>1.909516</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>time/cell</td> <td>0.000239</td> <td>0.000773</td> <td>0.001626</td> <td>0.002813</td> <td>0.004279</td> <td>0.006245</td> </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    Is that good enough?
    Let's fit a couple of fourth-order polynomials to our data:
  </p>

  <table class="outlined">
    <tr> <td></td> <td><em> x<sup>4</sup> </em></td> <td><em> x<sup>3</sup> </em></td> <td><em> x<sup>2</sup> </em></td><td><em>x<sup>1</sup></em></td><td><em>x<sup>0</sup></em></td></tr>
    <tr> <td>time&nbsp;taken</td> <td>2.678&times;10<sup> -07</sup></td> <td>-2.692&times;10<sup> -05</sup></td> <td>1.760&times;10<sup> -03</sup></td> <td>-3.983&times;10<sup> -02</sup></td> <td>2.681&times;10<sup>-01</sup></td></tr>
    <tr> <td>time/cell</td> <td>-1.112&times;10<sup> -10</sup></td> <td>1.996&times;10<sup> -08</sup></td> <td>4.796&times;10<sup> -07</sup></td> <td>2.566&times;10<sup> -05</sup></td> <td>-1.295&times;10<sup>-04</sup></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    According to the first polynomial,
    a single run on a 1001&times;1001 grid will take almost 68 hours.
    What can we do to make it faster?
    The <em>wrong</em> answer is,
    "Guess why it's slow, start tweaking the code, and hope for the best."
    The right answer is to ask the computer where the time is going.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we do that,
    though,
    we really ought to justify our decision to model the program's performance
    using a fourth-order polynomial.
    Suppose our grid is N&times;N.
    Each time it wants to find the next cell to fill,
    our program examines each of the N<sup>2</sup> cells.
    In the best case,
    it has to fill about N/2 cells to reach the boundary
    (basically, by racing straight for the edge of the grid).
    In the worst case,
    it has to fill all of the interior cells
    before "breaking out" to the boundary,
    which means it has to fill (N-2)&times;(N-2) cells.
    That worst case therefore has a runtime of N<sup>2</sup>(N-2)<sup>2</sup> steps,
    which,
    for large N,
    is approximately N<sup>4</sup>.
    (For example,
    when N is 71,
    the difference between the two values is only about 5%.)
  </p>

  <p>
    This kind of analysis is computing's equivalent of engineers' back-of-the-envelope calculations.
    In technical terms,
    we would say that our algorithm is O(N<sup>4</sup>).
    In reality,
    because we're creating a fractal,
    we're actually going to fill about N<sup>1.5</sup> cells on average,
    so our running time is actually O(N<sup>3.5</sup>).
    That's still too big for practical simulations,
    though,
    so it's time to figure out what we can do about it.
