  Write a Python program that creates a new database
  in a file called <code>original.db</code>
  containing a single table called <code>Pressure</code>,
  with a single field called <code>reading</code>,
  and inserts 100,000 random numbers between 10.0 and 25.0.
  How long does it take this program to run?
  How long does it take to run a program
  that simply writes those random numbers to a file?
