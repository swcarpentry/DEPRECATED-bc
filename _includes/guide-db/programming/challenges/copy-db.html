<p>
  Write a Python program that creates a new database
  called <code>backup.db</code>
  with the same structure as <code>original.db</code>
  and copies all the values greater than 20.0
  from <code>original.db</code> to <code>backup.db</code>.
  Which is faster:
  filtering values in the query,
  or reading everything into memory and filtering in Python?
