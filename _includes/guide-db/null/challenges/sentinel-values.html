<p>
  Some database designers prefer to use
  a <a href="glossary.html#sentinel-value">sentinel value</a>
  to mark missing data rather than <code>null</code>.
  For example,
  they will use the date "0000-00-00" to mark a missing date,
  or -1.0 to mark a missing salinity or radiation reading
  (since actual readings cannot be negative).
  What does this simplify?
  What burdens or risks does it introduce?
