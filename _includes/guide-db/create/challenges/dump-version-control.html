  SQLite has several administrative commands that aren't part of the SQL standard.
  One of them is <code>.dump</code>,
  which prints the SQL commands needed to re-create the database.
  Another is <code>.load</code>,
  which reads a file created by <code>.dump</code> and restores the database.
  A colleague of yours thinks that storing dump files (which are text) in version control
  is a good way to track and manage changes to the database.
  What are the pros and cons of this approach?
