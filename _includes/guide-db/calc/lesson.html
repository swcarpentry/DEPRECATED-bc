    After carefully reading the expedition logs,
    Gina realizes that the radiation measurements they report
    may need to be corrected upward by 5%.
    Rather than modifying the stored data,
    she can do this calculation on the fly
    as part of her query:
  </p>

  <table class="db">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1">
<pre>select 1.05 * reading from Survey where quant='rad';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>10.311</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8.19</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8.8305</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7.581</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4.5675</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.2995</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1.533</td></tr>
    <tr><td>11.8125</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    When we run the query,
    the expression <code>1.05 * reading</code> is evaluated for each row.
    Expressions can use any of the fields,
    all of usual arithmetic operators,
    and a variety of common functions.
    (Exactly which ones depends on which database manager is being used.)
    For example,
    we can convert temperature readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius
    and round to two decimal places as follows:
  </p>

  <table class="db">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">
<pre>select taken, round(5*(reading-32)/9, 2) from Survey where quant='temp';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>734</td><td>-29.72</td></tr>
    <tr><td>735</td><td>-32.22</td></tr>
    <tr><td>751</td><td>-28.06</td></tr>
    <tr><td>752</td><td>-26.67</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    We can also combine values from different fields,
    for example by using the string concatenation operator <code>||</code>:
  </p>

  <table class="db">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1">
<pre>select personal || ' ' || family from Person;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>William Dyer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Frank Pabodie</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Anderson Lake</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Valentina Roerich</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Frank Danforth</td></tr>

    <h3>A Note on Names</h3>

    <p>
      It may seem strange to use <code>personal</code> and <code>family</code> as field names
      instead of <code>first</code> and <code>last</code>,
      but it's a necessary first step toward handling cultural differences.
      For example,
      consider the following rules:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Full Name</th>
        <th>Alphabetized Under</th>
        <th>Reason</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liu Xiaobo</td>
        <td>Liu</td>
        <td>Chinese family names come first</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Leonardo da Vinci</td>
        <td>Leonardo</td>
        <td>"da Vinci" just means "from Vinci"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Catherine de Medici</td>
        <td>Medici</td>
        <td>family name</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jean de La Fontaine</td>
        <td>La Fontaine</td>
        <td>family name is "La Fontaine"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Juan Ponce de Leon</td>
        <td>Ponce de Leon</td>
        <td>full family name is "Ponce de Leon"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</td>
        <td>Garcia Marquez</td>
        <td>double-barrelled Spanish surnames</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Wernher von Braun</td>
        <td>von <em>or</em> Braun</td>
        <td>depending on whether he was in Germany or the US</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Elizabeth Alexandra May Windsor</td>
        <td>Elizabeth</td>
        <td>monarchs alphabetize by the name under which they reigned</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Thomas a Beckett</td>
        <td>Thomas</td>
        <td>and saints according to the names by which they were canonized</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="continue">
      Clearly,
      even a two-part division into "personal" and "family"
      isn't enough...
