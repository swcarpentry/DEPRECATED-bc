    Gina now wants to calculate ranges and averages for her data.
    She knows how to select all of the dates from the <code>Visited</code> table:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select dated from Visited;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p class='continue'>
    but to combine them,
    she must use an <a href='glossary.html#aggregation-function'>aggregation function</a>
    such as <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>.
    Each of these functions takes a set of records as input,
    and produces a single record as output:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select min(dated) from Visited;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select max(dated) from Visited;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are just two of
    the aggregation functions built into SQL.
    Three others are <code>avg</code>,
    <code>count</code>,
    and <code>sum</code>:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select avg(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>7.20333333333</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select count(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>9</td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select sum(reading) from Survey where quant='sal';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>64.83</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    We used <code>count(reading)</code> here,
    but we could just as easily have counted <code>quant</code>
    or any other field in the table,
    or even used <code>count(*)</code>,
    since the function doesn't care about the values themselves,
    just how many values there are.
  </p>

  <p>
    SQL lets us do several aggregations at once.
    We can,
    for example,
    find the range of sensible salinity measurements:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='2'>
<pre>select min(reading), max(reading) from Survey where quant='sal' and reading&lt;=1.0;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>0.05</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    We can also combine aggregated results with raw results,
    although the output might surprise you:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='2'>
<pre>select person, count(*) from Survey where quant='sal' and reading&lt;=1.0;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>lake</td><td>7</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    Why does Lake's name appear rather than Roerich's or Dyer's?
    The answer is that when it has to aggregate a field,
    but isn't told how to,
    the database manager chooses an actual value from the input set.
    It might use the first one processed,
    the last one,
    or something else entirely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another important fact is that when there are no values to aggregate,
    aggregation's result is "don't know"
    rather than zero or some other arbitrary value:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='3'>
<pre>select person, max(reading), sum(reading) from Survey where quant='missing';</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td /><td /><td /></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    One final important feature of aggregation functions is that
    they are inconsistent with the rest of SQL in a very useful way.
    If we add two values,
    and one of them is null,
    the result is null.
    By extension,
    if we use <code>sum</code> to add all the values in a set,
    and any of those values are null,
    the result should also be null.
    It's much more useful,
    though,
    for aggregation functions to ignore null values
    and only combine those that are non-null.
    This behavior lets us write our queries as:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select min(dated) from Visited;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p class='continue'>
    instead of always having to filter explicitly:
  </p>

  <table class='db'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan='1'>
<pre>select min(dated) from Visited <span class='highlight'>where dated is not null</span>;</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
  </table>

</div></body></html>
