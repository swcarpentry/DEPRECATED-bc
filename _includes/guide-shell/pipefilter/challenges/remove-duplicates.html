<p>
  The command:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>
  produces the following output:
</p>

<pre>
<span class="out">deer
rabbit
raccoon
rabbit
deer
fox
rabbit
bear</span>
</pre>

<p>
  What other command(s) could be added to this in a pipeline to find out
  what animals have been seen
  (without any duplicates in the animals' names)?
</p>
