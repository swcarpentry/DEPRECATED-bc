  The command <code>uniq</code> removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input.
  For example,
  if a file <code>salmon.txt</code> contains:
</p>

<pre>
coho
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
steelhead
</pre>

<p>
  then <code>uniq salmon.txt</code> produces:
</p>

<pre>
coho
steelhead
coho
steelhead
</pre>

<p>
  Why do you think <code>uniq</code> only removes <em>adjacent</em> duplicated lines?
  (Hint: think about very large data sets.)
  What other command could you combine with it in a pipe
  to remove all duplicated lines?
