<p>
  If you run the command:
</p>

<pre>
history | tail -5 &gt; recent.sh
</pre>

<p>
  the last command in the file is the <code>history</code> command itself,
  i.e.,
  the shell has added <code>history</code> to the command log
  before actually running it.
  In fact,
  the shell <em>always</em> adds commands to the log before running them.
  Why do you think it does this?
