  What does <code>cp</code> do
  when given several filenames and a directory name,
  as in:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">mkdir backup</span>
$ <span class="in">cp thesis/citations.txt thesis/quotations.txt backup</span>
</pre>

<p>
  What does <code>cp</code> do when given three or more filenames,
  as in:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">intro.txt    methods.txt    survey.txt</span>
$ <span class="in">cp intro.txt methods.txt survey.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>
  Why do you think <code>cp</code>'s behavior is different from <code>mv</code>'s?
