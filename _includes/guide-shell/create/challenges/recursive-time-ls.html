<p>
  The command <code>ls&nbsp;-R</code> lists the contents of directories recursively,
  i.e.,
  lists their sub-directories,
  sub-sub-directories,
  and so on
  in alphabetical order at each level.
  The command <code>ls&nbsp;-t</code> lists things by time of last change,
  with most recently changed files or directories first.
  In what order does <code>ls&nbsp;-R&nbsp;-t</code> display things?
