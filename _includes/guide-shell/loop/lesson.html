<div id="s:shell:loop:lesson" class="lesson">

  <p>
    Wildcards and tabs are one way to save on typing.
    Another is to tell the shell to do something over and over again.
    Suppose we have several hundred genome data files in a directory
    with names like <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    <code>unicorn.dat</code>,
    and so on.
    When new files arrive,
    we'd like to rename the existing ones to
    <code>original-basilisk.dat</code>,
    <code>original-unicorn.dat</code>,
    etc.
    We can't use:
  </p>

<pre>
mv *.dat original-*.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    because that would expand (in the two-file case) to:
  </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This wouldn't back up our files:
    it would replace the content of <code>unicorn.dat</code>
    with whatever's in <code>basilisk.dat</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead,
    we can use a <a href="glossary.html#for-loop">loop</a>
    to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
    Here's a simple example
    that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat</span>
&gt; <span class="in">do</span>
&gt;    <span class="in">head -3 $filename</span>
&gt; <span class="in">done</span>
<span class="out">COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
COMMON NAME: unicorn
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
UPDATED: 1738-11-24</span>
</pre>

  <p>
    When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>,
    it knows it is supposed to repeat a command (or group of commands)
    once for each thing in a list.
    In this case,
    the list is the two filenames.
    Each time through the loop,
    the name of the thing currently being operated on
    is assigned to the <a href="glossary.html#variable">variable</a> <code>filename</code>.
    Inside the loop,
    we get the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it,
    so the first time through the loop,
    <code>$filename</code> is <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    and the second time,
    <code>unicorn.dat</code>.
    Finally,
    the command that's actually being run is our old friend <code>head</code>,
    so this loop prints out the first three lines of each data file in turn.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Follow the Prompt</h3>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that the shell prompt changed
      from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again
      as we were typing in our loop.
      The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>,
      is different to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>What's In a Name?</h3>

    <p>
      We have called the variable in this loop <code>filename</code>
      in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
      The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
      if we wrote this loop as:
    </p>

<pre>
for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $x
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      or:
    </p>

<pre>
for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -3 $temperature
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      it would work exactly the same way.
      <em>Don't do this.</em>
      Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
      so using meaningless names (like <code>x</code>)
      or misleading names (like <code>temperature</code>)
      increases the likelihood of the program being wrong.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Here's a slightly more complicated loop:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

  <p>
    The shell starts by expanding <code>*.dat</code>
    to create the list of files it will process.
    The <a href="glossary.html#loop-body">loop body</a> then executes two commands
    for each of those files.
    The first,
    <code>echo</code>,
    just prints its command-line parameters to standard output.
    For example:
  </p>

<pre>
echo hello there
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    prints:
  </p>

<pre>
hello there
</pre>

  <p>
    In this case,
    since the shell expands <code>$filename</code> to be the name of a file,
    <code>echo $filename</code> just prints the name of the file.
    Note that we can't write this as:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    <span class="highlight">$filename</span>
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    because then the first time through the loop,
    when <code>$filename</code> expanded to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    the shell would try to run <code>basilisk.dat</code> as a program.
    Finally,
    the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> combination
    selects lines 80-100 from whatever file is being processed.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Spaces in Names</h3>

    <p>
      Filename expansion in loops is another reason
      <a href="#a:space-in-filename">you should <em>not</em> use spaces in filenames</a>.
      Suppose our data files are named:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat
red dragon.dat
unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      If we try to process them using:
    </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -100 $filename | tail -20
done
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      then <code>*.dat</code> will expand to:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat red dragon.dat unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which means that <code>filename</code> will be assigned
      each of the following values in turn:
    </p>

<pre>
basilisk.dat
<span class="highlight">red
dragon.dat</span>
unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p>
      The highlighted lands show the problem:
      instead of getting one name <code>red&nbsp;dragon.dat</code>,
      the commands in the loop will get <code>red</code> and <code>dragon.dat</code> separately.
      To make matters worse,
      the file <code>red&nbsp;dragon.dat</code> won't be processed at all.
      There are ways to get around this,
      but the safest thing is to use dashes,
      underscores,
      or some other printable character instead.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Going back to our original file renaming problem,
    we can solve it using this loop:
  </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    mv $filename original-$filename
done
</pre>

  <p>
    This loop runs the <code>mv</code> command once for each filename.
    The first time,
    when <code>$filename</code> expands to <code>basilisk.dat</code>,
    the shell executes:
  </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The second time,
    the command is:
  </p>

<pre>
mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Measure Twice, Run Once</h3>

    <p>
      A loop is a way to do many things at once&mdash;or
      to make many mistakes at once
      if it does the wrong thing.
      One way to check what a loop <em>would</em> do is
      to echo the commands it would run
      instead of actually running them.
      For example,
      we could write our file renaming loop like this:
    </p>

<pre>
for filename in *.dat
do
    <span class="highlight">echo</span> mv $filename original-$filename
done
</pre>

    <p>
      Instead of running <code>mv</code>,
      this loop runs <code>echo</code>,
      which prints out:
    </p>

<pre>
mv basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
mv unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      <em>without</em> actually running those commands.
      We can then use up-arrow to redisplay the loop,
      back-arrow to get to the word <code>echo</code>,
      delete it,
      and then press "enter" to run the loop
      with the actual <code>mv</code> commands.
      This isn't foolproof,
      but it's a handy way to see what's going to happen
      when you're still learning how loops work.

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files</h3>

    <p>
      Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
      Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
      she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
      Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files&mdash;remember,
      these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z':
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</span>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile
done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      Her next step is to figure out what to call the files
      that the <code>goostat</code> analysis program will create.
      Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
      so she modifies her loop to do that:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt
do
    echo $datafile stats-$datafile
done</span>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      She hasn't actually run <code>goostats</code> yet,
      but now she's sure she can select the right files
      and generate the right output filenames.
    </p>

    <p id="a:repeat">
      Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
      though,
      and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
      so instead of re-entering her loop,
      she presses the up arrow.
      In response,
      Bash redisplays the whole loop on one line
      (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      Using the left arrow key,
      Nelle backs up and changes the command <code>echo</code> to <code>goostats</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do <span class="highlight">goostats</span> $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      When she presses enter,
      Bash runs the modified command.
      However,
      nothing appears to happen&mdash;there is no output.
      After a moment,
      Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
      she has no idea whether it is running,
      much less how quickly.
      She kills the job by typing Control-C,
      uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
      and edits it to read:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">for datafile in *[AB].txt; do <span class="highlight">echo $datafile;</span> goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      When she runs her program now,
      it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="out">NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...</span>
$
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60,
      tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
      As a final check,
      she opens another terminal window,
      goes into <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>,
      and uses <code>cat NENE01729B.txt</code> to examine
      one of the output files.
      It looks good,
      so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h3>Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It</h3>

      <p>
        Another way to repeat previous work is to use the <code>history</code> command
        to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed,
        and then to use <code>!123</code> (where "123" is replaced by the command number)
        to repeat one of those commands.
        For example,
        if Nelle types this:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">$ history | tail -5</span>
<span class="out">  456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
  458  goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
  459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
  460  history</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        then she can re-run <code>goostats</code> on <code>NENE01729B.txt</code>
        simply by typing <code>!458</code>.
      </p>

    </div>
