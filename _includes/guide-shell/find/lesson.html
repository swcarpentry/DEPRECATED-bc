  <p>
    You can often guess someone's age by listening to how people talk about search
    (<a href="#f:google_vs_grep">Figure 17</a>).
    Just as young people use "Google" as a verb,
    crusty old Unix programmers use "grep".
    The word is a contraction of "global/regular expression/print",
    a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
    It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>grep</code> finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
    For our examples,
    we will use a file that contains three haikus
    taken from a <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/chal/1998/01/26chal.html">1998 competition in Salon magazine</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
</pre>

  <p>
    Let's find lines that contain the word "not":
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep not haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Is not the true Tao, until
"My Thesis" not found
Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Here, <code>not</code> is the pattern we're searching for.
    It's pretty simple: every alphanumeric character matches against itself.
    After the pattern comes the name or names of the files we're searching in.
    The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters "not".
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's try a different pattern: "day".
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep day haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    This time,
    the output is lines containing the words "Yesterday" and "Today",
    which both have the letters "day".
    If we give <code>grep</code> the <code>-w</code> flag,
    it restricts matches to word boundaries,
    so that only lines with the word "day" will be printed:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -w day haiku.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    In this case, there aren't any, so <code>grep</code>'s output is empty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another useful option is <code>-n</code>, which numbers the lines that match:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -n it haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">5:With searching comes loss
9:Yesterday it worked
10:Today it is not working</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters "it".
  </p>

  <p>
    As with other Unix commands, we can combine flags.
    For example,
    since <code>-i</code> makes matching case-insensitive,
    and <code>-v</code> inverts the match,
    using them both only prints lines that <em>don't</em> match the pattern
    in any mix of upper and lower case:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -i -v the haiku.txt</span>
<span class="out">You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    <code>grep</code> has lots of other options.
    To find out what they are, we can type <code>man grep</code>.
    <code>man</code> is the Unix "manual" command.
    It prints a description of a command and its options,
    and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">man grep</span>
<span class="out">GREP(1)                                                                                              GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
       grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-
       minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep
       prints the matching lines.
       &hellip;        &hellip;        &hellip;

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information
       --help Print  a  usage  message  briefly summarizing these command-line options and the bug-reporting
              address, then exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of grep to the standard output stream.  This version number should be
              included in all bug reports (see below).

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN  as  an  extended regular expression (ERE, see below).  (-E is specified by
              POSIX.)

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of  which  is  to  be
              matched.  (-F is specified by POSIX.)
    &hellip;        &hellip;        &hellip;</span>

    <h3>Wildcards</h3>

    <p>
      <code>grep</code>'s real power doesn't come from its options, though;
      it comes from the fact that patterns can include wildcards.
      (The technical name for these is
      <a href="glossary.html#regular-expression">regular expressions</a>,
      which is what the "re" in "grep" stands for.)
      Regular expressions are complex enough that
      we devoted an entire section of the website to them;
      if you want to do complex searches,
      please check it out.
      As a taster,
      we can find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep -E '^.o' haiku.txt</span>
You bring fresh toner.
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      We use the <code>-E</code> flag and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell from trying to interpret it.
      (If the pattern contained a '*', for example, the shell would try to expand it before running <code>grep</code>.)
      The '^' in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line.
      The '.' matches a single character
      (just like '?' in the shell),
      while the 'o' matches an actual 'o'.
    </p>
    
  </div>

  <p>
    While <code>grep</code> finds lines in files,
    the <code>find</code> command finds files themselves.
    Again, it has a lot of options;
    to show how the simplest ones work, we'll use the directory tree in
    <a href="#f:find_file_tree">Figure 18</a>:
  </p>

  <figure id="f:find_file_tree">
    <img src="find_file_tree.png" alt="Sample Files and Directories" />
    <figcaption>Figure 18: Sample Files and Directories</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="continue">
    Vlad's home directory contains one file called <code>notes.txt</code> and four subdirectories:
    <code>thesis</code> (which is sadly empty),
    <code>data</code> (which contains two files <code>first.txt</code> and <code>second.txt</code>),
    a <code>tools</code> directory that contains the programs <code>format</code> and <code>stats</code>,
    and an empty subdirectory called <code>old</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our first command, let's run <code>find . -type d</code>.
    <code>.</code> is the directory where we want our search to start;
    <code>-type&nbsp;d</code> means "things that are directories".
    Sure enough,
    <code>find</code>'s output is the names of the five directories in our little tree
    (including <code>.</code>, the current working directory):
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -type d</span>
<span class="out">./
./data
./thesis
./tools
./tools/old</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    If we change <code>-type&nbsp;d</code> to <code>-type&nbsp;f</code>,
    we get a listing of all the files instead:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>find</code> automatically goes into subdirectories,
    their subdirectories,
    and so on to find everything that matches the pattern we've given it.
    If we don't want it to,
    we can use <code>-maxdepth</code> to restrict the depth of search:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -maxdepth 1 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The opposite of <code>-maxdepth</code> is <code>-mindepth</code>,
    which tells <code>find</code> to only report things that are at or below a certain depth.
    <code>-mindepth&nbsp;2</code> therefore finds all the files that are two or more levels below us:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -mindepth 2 -type f</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./tools/format
./tools/stats</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Another option is <code>-empty</code>,
    which restricts matches to empty files and directories:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -empty</span>
<span class="out">./thesis
./tools/old</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Now let's try matching by name:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name *.txt</span>
<span class="out">./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    We expected it to find all the text files,
    but it only prints out <code>./notes.txt</code>.
    The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like <code>*</code> <em>before</em> commands run.
    Since <code>*.txt</code> in the current directory expands to <code>notes.txt</code>,
    the command we actually ran was:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name notes.txt</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>find</code> did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get what we want,
    let's do what we did with <code>grep</code>:
    put <code>*.txt</code> in single quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the <code>*</code> wildcard.
    This way,
    <code>find</code> actually gets the pattern <code>*.txt</code>,
    not the expanded filename <code>notes.txt</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">find . -name '*.txt'</span>
<span class="out">./data/first.txt
./data/second.txt
./notes.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    As we said <a href="#s:pipefilter">earlier</a>,
    the command line's power lies in combining tools.
    We've seen how to do that with pipes; let's look at another technique.
    As we just saw, <code>find . -name '*.txt'</code> gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.
    How can we combine that with <code>wc -l</code> to count the lines in all those files?
  </p>

  <p>
    One way is to put the <code>find</code> command inside <code>$()</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')</span>
<span class="out">  70  ./data/first.txt
 420  ./data/second.txt
  30  ./notes.txt
 520  total</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    When the shell executes this command,
    the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the <code>$()</code>.
    It then replaces the <code>$()</code> expression with that command's output.
    Since the output of <code>find</code> is the three filenames
    <code>./data/first.txt</code>, <code>./data/second.txt</code>, and <code>./notes.txt</code>,
    the shell constructs the command:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">wc -l ./data/first.txt ./data/second.txt ./notes.txt</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    which is what we wanted.
    This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>,
    but lets us use any command we want as our own "wildcard".
  </p>

  <p>
    It's very common to use <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> together.
    The first finds files that match a pattern;
    the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
    Here, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms
    by looking for the string "FE" in all the <code>.pdb</code> files below the current directory:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">grep FE $(find . -name '*.pdb')</span>
<span class="out">./human/heme.pdb:ATOM  25  FE  1  -0.924  0.535  -0.518</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Binary Files</h3>

    <p>
      We have focused exclusively on finding things in text files.
      What if your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?
      One option would be to extend tools like <code>grep</code> to handle those formats.
      This hasn't happened, and probably won't, because there are too many formats to support.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second option is to convert the data to text,
      or extract the text-ish bits from the data.
      This is probably the most common approach,
      since it only requires people to build one tool per data format (to extract information).
      On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do.
      On the negative side, complex things are usually impossible.
      For example,
      it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for <code>grep</code> to play with,
      but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?
    </p>

    <p>
      The third choice is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits,
      and to use a programming language such as Python instead.
      When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell:
      many modern programming languages, Python included, have borrowed a lot of ideas from it,
      and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.
    </p>

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: The Second Stage</h3>

    <p>
      Nelle now has a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03</code>
      containing 1518 data files,
      and needs to compare each one against all of the others
      to find the hundred pairs with the highest pairwise scores.
      Armed with what she has learned so far,
      she writes the following script
    </p>

<pre>
# Compare all pairs of files.
for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done
</pre>

    <p>
      The outermost loop assigns the name of each file to the variable <code>left</code> in turn.
      The inner loop does the same thing for the variable <code>right</code>
      each time the outer loop executes,
      so inside the inner loop,
      <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are given
      each pair of filenames.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time it runs the command inside the inner loop,
      the shell starts by running <code>goodiff</code> on the two files
      in order to expand the <code>$()</code> expression.
      Once it's done that,
      it passes the output,
      along with the names of the files,
      to <code>echo</code>.
      Thus,
      if Nelle saves this script as <code>pairwise.sh</code>
      and runs it as:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      the shell runs:
    </p>

<pre>
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt)
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt)
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt $(goodiff stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt)
...
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which turns into:
    </p>

<pre>
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt files are identical
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt 0.97182
echo stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt 0.45223
...
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      which in turn prints:
    </p>

<pre>
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt files are identical
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt 0.97182
stats-NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt 0.45223
...
</pre>

    <p>
      That's a good start,
      but Nelle can do better.
      First,
      she notices that when the two input files are the same,
      the output is the words "files are identical"
      instead of a numerical score.
      She can remove these lines like this:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt | grep -v 'files are identical'</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      or put the call to <code>grep</code> inside the shell script
      (which will be less error-prone):
    </p>

<pre>
for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done <span class="highlight">| grep -v 'files are identical'</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      This works because <code>do</code>&hellip;<code>done</code>
      counts as a single command in Bash.
      If Nelle wanted to make this clearer,
      she could put parentheses around the loop:
    </p>

<pre>
<span class="highlight">(</span>for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        echo $left $right $(goodiff $left $right)
    done
done<span class="highlight">)</span> | grep -v 'files are identical'
</pre>

    <p>
      The last thing Nelle needs to do before writing up
      is find the 100 best pairwise matches.
      She has seen this before:
      sort the lines numerically,
      then use <code>head</code> to select the top lines.
      However,
      the numbers she wants to sort by are at the end of the line,
      rather than beginning.
      Reading the output of <code>man&nbsp;sort</code> tells her
      that the <code>-k</code> flag will let her specify
      which column of input she wants to use as a sort key,
      but the syntax looks a little complicated.
      Instead,
      she moves the score to the front of each line:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) | grep -v 'files are identical'
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and then adds two more commands to the pipeline:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) | grep -v 'files are identical' | sort -n -r | head -100
</pre>

    <p>
      Since this is hard to read,
      she uses <code>\</code> to tell the shell
      that she's continuing commands on the next line:
    </p>

<pre>
(for left in $*
do
    for right in $*
    do
        <span class="highlight">echo $(goodiff $left $right) $left $right</span>
    done
done) \
| grep -v 'files are identical' \
| sort -n -r \
| head -100
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      She then runs:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash pairwise.sh stats-*.txt &gt; top100.txt</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and heads off to a seminar,
      confident that by the time she comes back tomorrow,
      <code>top100.txt</code> will contain
      the results she needs for her paper.
    </p>
