<p>
  The <code>middle.sh</code> script's numerical parameters are
  the number of lines to take from the head of the file,
  and the number of lines to take from the tail of that range.
  It would be more intuitive if the parameters were
  the index of the first line to keep and the number of lines,
  e.g.,
  if:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash middle.sh somefile 50 5</span>
</pre>

<p>
  selected lines 50-54 instead of lines 46-50.
  Use <code>$()</code> and the <code>expr</code> command
  to do this.
</p>
