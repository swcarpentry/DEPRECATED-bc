  <p>
    The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
    is called the <a href="glossary.html#file-system">file system</a>.
    It organizes our data into files,
    which hold information,
    and directories (also called "folders"),
    which hold files or other directories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several commands are frequently used
    to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
    To start exploring them,
    let's log in to the computer by typing our user ID and password.
    Most systems will print stars to obscure the password,
    or nothing at all,
    in case some evildoer is shoulder surfing behind us.
  </p>

<pre>
login: <span class="in">vlad</span>
password: <span class="in">********</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    Once we have logged in we'll see a <a href="glossary.html#prompt">prompt</a>,
    which is how the shell tells us that it's waiting for input.
    This is usually just a dollar sign,
    but which may show extra information such as our user ID or the current time.
    Type the command <code class="in">whoami</code>,
    then press the <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> key
    (sometimes marked <span class="keyboard">Return</span>)
    to send the command to the shell.
    The command's output is the ID of the current user,
    i.e.,
    it shows us who the shell thinks we are:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">whoami</span>
<span class="out">vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    More specifically,
    when we type <code>whoami</code>
    the shell:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>finds a program called <code>whoami</code>,</li>
    <li>runs it,</li>
    <li>waits for it to display its output, and</li>
    <li>displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Getting Around</h3>

  <p>
    Next,
    let's find out where we are
    by running a command called <code>pwd</code>
    (which stands for "print working directory").
    At any moment,
    our <a href="glossary.html#current-working-directory">current working directory</a>
    is our current default directory,
    i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in
    unless we explicitly specify something else.
    Here,
    the computer's response is <code class="out">/users/vlad</code>,
    which is Vlad's <a href="glossary.html#home-directory">home directory</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Alphabet Soup</h3>

    <p>
      If the command to find out <em>who</em> we are is <code>whoami</code>,
      the command to find out <em>where</em> we are ought to be called <code>whereami</code>,
      so why is it <code>pwd</code> instead?
      The usual answer is that in the early 1970s,
      when Unix was first being developed,
      every keystroke counted:
      the devices of the day were slow,
      and backspacing on a teletype was so painful
      that cutting the number of keystrokes
      in order to cut the number of typing mistakes
      was actually a win for usability.
      The reality is that commands were added to Unix one by one,
      without any master plan,
      by people who were immersed in its jargon.
      The result is as inconsistent as the roolz uv Inglish speling,
      but we're stuck with it now.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    To understand what a "home directory" is,
    let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized
    (<a href="#f:filesystem">Figure 4</a>).
    At the top is the <a href="glossary.html#root-directory">root directory</a>
    that holds everything else the computer is storing.
    We refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code> on its own;
    this is the leading slash in <code>/users/vlad</code>.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:filesystem">
    <img src="filesystem.png" alt="File System" />
    <figcaption>Figure 4: File System</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Inside that directory (or underneath it, if you're drawing a tree) are several other directories:
    <code>bin</code> (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
    <code>data</code> (for miscellaneous data files),
    <code>users</code> (where users' personal directories are located),
    <code>tmp</code> (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
    and so on.
    We know that our current working directory <code>/users/vlad</code> is stored inside <code>/users</code>
    because <code>/users</code> is the first part of its name.
    Similarly,
    we know that <code>/users</code> is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because its name begins with <code>/</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Underneath <code>/users</code>,
    we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine
    (<a href="#f:home_directories">Figure 5</a>).
    The Mummy's files are stored in <code>/users/imhotep</code>,
    Wolfman's in <code>/users/larry</code>,
    and ours in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
    which is why <code>vlad</code> is the last part of the directory's name.
    Notice, by the way, that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code> character.
    When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory.
    When it appears <em>inside</em> a name, it's just a separator.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:home_directories">
    <img src="home_directories.png" alt="Home Directories" />
    <figcaption>Figure 5: Home Directories</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Let's see what's in Vlad's home directory by running <code>ls</code>,
    which stands for "listing":
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin          data      mail       music
notes.txt    papers    pizza.cfg  solar
solar.pdf    swc</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order,
    arranged neatly into columns.
    To make its output more comprehensible,
    we can give it the <a href="glossary.html#command-line-flag">flag</a> <code>-F</code> by typing <code>ls -F</code>.
    This tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    As you can see,
    <code>/users/vlad</code> contains seven <a href="glossary.html#sub-directory">sub-directories</a>
    (<a href="#f:vlad_homedir">Figure 6</a>).
    The names that don't have trailing slashes&mdash;<code>notes.txt</code>, <code>pizza.cfg</code>, and <code>solar.pdf</code>&mdash;are
    plain old files.
  </p>

  <figure id="f:vlad_homedir">
    <img src="vlad_homedir.png" alt="Vlad's Home Directory" />
    <figcaption>Figure 6: Vlad's Home Directory</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>What's In A Name?</h3>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that all of Vlad's files' names are "something dot something".
      This is just a convention:
      we can call a file <code>mythesis</code> or almost anything else we want.
      However,
      most people use two-part names most of the time
      to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart.
      The second part of such a name is called the <a href="glossary.html#filename-extension">filename extension</a>,
      and indicates what type of data the file holds:
      <code>.txt</code> signals a plain text file,
      <code>.pdf</code> indicates a PDF document,
      <code>.cfg</code> is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to remember that this is just a convention.
      Files contain bytes:
      it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for PDF documents, images, and so on.
      For example,
      naming a PNG image of a whale as <code>whale.mp3</code>
      doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Now let's take a look at what's in Vlad's <code>data</code> directory
    by running the command <code>ls -F data</code>.
    The second parameter&mdash;the one <em>without</em> a leading dash&mdash;tells
    <code>ls</code> that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F data</span>
<span class="out">amino_acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories.
    Organizing things hierarchically in this way
    is a good way to keep track of our work:
    it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
    just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
    but in the long run it's a self-defeating strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice,
    by the way
    that we spelled the directory name <code>data</code>.
    It doesn't have a trailing slash:
    that's added to directory names by <code>ls</code>
    when we use the <code>-F</code> flag
    to help us tell things apart.
    And it doesn't begin with a slash
    because it's a <a href="glossary.html#relative-path">relative path</a>,
    i.e., it tells <code>ls</code> how to find something from where we are,
    rather than from the root of the file system
    (<a href="#f:relative_path">Figure 7</a>).
  </p>

  <figure id="f:relative_path">
    <img src="absolute_relative_path.png" alt="Absolute and Relative Paths" />
    <figcaption>Figure 7: Absolute and Relative Paths</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    If we run <code>ls -F /data</code>
    (<em>with</em> a leading slash)
    we get a different answer,
    because <code>/data</code> is an <a href="glossary.html#absolute-path">absolute path</a>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F /data</span>
<span class="out">access.log    backup/    hardware.cfg
network.cfg</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    The leading <code>/</code> tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the filesystem,
    so it always refers to exactly one directory,
    no matter where we are when we run the command.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if we want to change our current working directory?
    Before we do this,
    <code>pwd</code> shows us that we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>,
    and <code>ls</code> without any parameters shows us that directory's contents:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">bin/         data/     mail/      music/
notes.txt    papers/   pizza.cfg  solar/
solar.pdf    swc/</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    We can use <code>cd</code> followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
    <code>cd</code> stands for "change directory",
    which is a bit misleading:
    the command doesn't change the directory,
    it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd data</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>cd</code> doesn't print anything,
    but if we run <code>pwd</code> after it,
    we can see that we are now in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>.
    If we run <code>ls</code> without parameters now,
    it lists the contents of <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
    because that's where we now are:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">amino_acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt</span>
$
</pre>

    <p>
      OK, we can go down the directory tree: how do we go up?
      We could use an absolute path:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cd /users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    but it's almost always simpler to use <code>cd&nbsp;..</code>
    to go up one level:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad/data</span>
$ <span class="in">cd ..</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue">
    <code>..</code> is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one",
    or,
    more succinctly,
    the <a href="glossary.html#parent-directory">parent</a> of the current directory.
  </p>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>No Output = OK</h3>

    <p>
      In general, shell programs do not output anything
      if no errors occurred. The principle behind this is
      "If there is nothing to report, shut up.", i. e. if
      there is output, either you specifically requested the
      program to do so or something bad happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not apply to programs like <code>ls</code> or 
      <code>pwd</code>, since the purpose of such programs is
      to output something.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p class="continue">
    Sure enough,
    if we run <code>pwd</code> after running <code>cd&nbsp;..</code>,
    we're back in <code>/users/vlad</code>:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

  <p>
    The special directory <code>..</code> doesn't usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>.
    If we want to display it,
    we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code> flag:
  </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls -F -a</span>
<span class="out">./           ../       bin/       data/
mail/        music/    notes.txt  papers/
pizza.cfg    solar/    solar.pdf  swc/</span>
</pre>

  <p class="continue" id="a:dot-directory">
    <code>-a</code> stands for "show all";
    it forces <code>ls</code> to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>,
    such as <code>..</code>
    (which, if we're in <code>/users/vlad</code>, refers to the <code>/users</code> directory).
    As you can see,
    it also displays another special directory that's just called <code>.</code>,
    which means "the current working directory".
    It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
    but we'll see some uses for it <a href="#a:move-to-here">soon</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Orthogonality</h3>

    <p>
      The special names <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> don't belong to <code>ls</code>;
      they are interpreted the same way by every program.
      For example,
      if we are in <code>/users/vlad/data</code>,
      the command <code>ls&nbsp;..</code>
      will give us a listing of <code>/users/vlad</code>.
      Programmers call this <a href="glossary.html#orthogonality">orthogonality</a>:
      the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined.
      Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
      because there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Everything we have seen so far works on Unix and its descendents,
    such as Linux and Mac OS X.
    Things are a bit different on Windows.
    A typical directory path on a Windows 7 machine might be <code>C:\Users\vlad</code>.
    The first part, <code>C:</code>, is a <a href="glossary.html#drive-letter">drive letter</a>
    that identifies which disk we're talking about.
    This notation dates back to the days of floppy drives;
    today,
    different "drives" are usually different filesystems on the network.
  </p>

  <p id="a:space-in-filename">
    Instead of a forward slash,
    Windows uses a backslash to separate the names in a path.
    This causes headaches because Unix uses backslash for input of special characters.
    For example,
    if we want to put a space in a filename on Unix,
    we would write the filename as <code>my\&nbsp;results.txt</code>.
    Please don't ever do this, though:
    if you put spaces,
    question marks,
    and other special characters in filenames on Unix,
    you can confuse the shell for reasons that we'll see shortly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    Windows filenames and directory names are <a href="glossary.html#case-insensitive">case insensitive</a>:
    upper and lower case letters mean the same thing.
    This means that the path name <code>C:\Users\vlad</code> could be spelled
    <code>c:\users\VLAD</code>,
    <code>C:\Users\Vlad</code>,
    and so on.
    Some people argue that this is more natural:
    after all, "VLAD" in all upper case and "Vlad" spelled normally refer to the same person.
    However,
    it causes headaches for programmers,
    and can be difficult for people to understand
    if their first language doesn't use a cased alphabet.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>For Cygwin Users</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.cygwin.org">Cygwin</a> tries to make Windows paths look more like Unix paths
      by allowing us to use a forward slash instead of a backslash as a separator.
      It also allows us to refer to the C drive as <code>/cygdrive/c/</code> instead of as <code>C:</code>.
      (The latter usually works too, but not always.)
      Paths are still case insensitive,
      though,
      which means that if you try to put files called <code>backup.txt</code> (in all lower case)
      and <code>Backup.txt</code> (with a capital 'B') into the same directory,
      the second will overwrite the first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cygwin does something else that frequently causes confusion.
      By default,
      it interprets a path like <code>/home/vlad</code> to mean <code>C:\cygwin\home\vlad</code>,
      i.e.,
      it acts as if <code>C:\cygwin</code> was the root of the filesystem.
      This is sometimes helpful,
      but if you are using an editor like Notepad,
      and want to save a file in what Cygwin thinks of as your home directory,
      you need to keep this translation in mind.

    <h3>Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files</h3>

    <p>
      Knowing just this much about files and directories,
      Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
      First,
      she creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>
      (to remind herself where the data came from).
      Inside that, she creates a directory called <code>2012-07-03</code>,
      which is the date she started processing the samples.
      She used to use names like <code>conference-paper</code> and <code>revised-results</code>,
      but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
      (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called
      <code>revised-revised-results-3</code>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of her physical samples is labelled
      according to her lab's convention
      with a unique ten-character ID,
      such as "NENE01729A".
      This is what she used in her collection log to record the location,
      time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
      so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
      Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
      she will call her files <code>NENE01729A.txt</code>,
      <code>NENE01812A.txt</code>,
      and so on.
      All 1520 files will go into the same directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      If she is in her home directory,
      Nelle can see what files she has using the command:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/</span>
</pre>

    <p>
      Since this is a lot to type,
      she can take advantage of Bash's
      <a href="glossary.html#command-completion">command completion</a>.
      If she types:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls no</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      and then presses <span class="in">tab</span>,
      Bash will automatically complete the directory name for her:
    </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls north-pacific-gyre/</span>
</pre>

    <p class="continue">
      If she presses tab again,
      Bash will add <code>2012-07-03/</code> to the command,
      since it's the only possible completion.
      Pressing tab again does nothing,
      since there are 1520 possibilities;
      pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
      and so on.
      This is called <a id="a:tab-completion" href="glossary.html#tab-completion">tab completion</a>,
      and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.
    </p>
