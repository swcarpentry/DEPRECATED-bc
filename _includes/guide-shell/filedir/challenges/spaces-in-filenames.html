<p>
  We said <a href="#a:space-in-filename">earlier</a> that
  spaces in path names have to be marked with a leading backslash
  in order for the shell to interpret them properly.
  Why?
  What happens if we run a command like:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ls my\ thesis\ files</span>
</pre>

<p class="continue">
  <em>without</em> the backslashes?
</p>
