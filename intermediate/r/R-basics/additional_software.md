## Additional software to install

**Make** *installation necessary only for Windows*

Linux and Mac users already have Make pre-installed. Windows users will need to install Make separately to work with Gitbash. Please follow these instructions below if you have a windows laptop. If you run into trouble please ask one of the helpers to assist you.

**Pandoc** *Installation required for everyone*

Depending on time and progress on the proposed schedule, we may get to converting parsed markdown documents from markdown to publication ready pdfs. To acheive this you'll need to have a Latex interpreter installed on your laptop.

* To convert documents to PDF you'll need LaTex installed. 

**Latex** *Only for Windows and Mac users*

[For Mac users](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) For today please just install [BasicTex](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/mactex-basic.pkg)  
[For Windows users](http://miktex.org/download) ~ 155 mb

Note: These are very large files and not something we can install on the limited internet we will have during the workshop. Please install on a faster connection (preferably at the end of the first day). 

Once Tex is installed, download `Pandoc` to use as a commmand-line tool for document conversion.
