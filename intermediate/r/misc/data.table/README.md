This lesson contains a Rmd file with code for and descriptions of several useful features of the `data.table` library, which is much much faster than base R for a range of data processing tasks. 

The lesson should take around **15 minutes** to work though, more if there is discussion of the special `data.table` syntax.  For a similar library, also useful to speed up table calculations, students may also want to check out Hadley Wickam's recently released [dplyr library](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/01/17/introducing-dplyr/).
