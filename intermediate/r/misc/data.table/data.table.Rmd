# Introduction to data.table

What is the `data.table` package for and why would you want to use it?  Doesn't base R come with data frames build in already? Turns out that there are some things that can be done MUCH faster and more easily with data.table. 

## Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("data.table", "microbenchmark"))
```

```{r load}
library(data.table)
library(microbenchmark)
```

## Read in a file

Almost every analysis project in R will require the loading of data. `data.table` can read in files more efficiently than the standard functions in R, including `read.csv()`, `read.table()`, or `scan()`. This means that large files load fast.  Let's take a look at the function `fread()`. 

```{r fread}
# First we make a data frame (10,000 rows long) and write it to a csv file, which we'll read in in the next step
df <- data.frame(a = 1:10^4, b = 1:10^4)
write.table(df, file="test.csv", sep=",", row.names=FALSE)

# instead of using read.csv(), we use fread(), a function provided in the data.frame library
fread("test.csv")

# We can track the amount of time a command takes to execute using the microbenchmark() function
(op <- microbenchmark(
  read.csv("test.csv"),
  fread("test.csv"),
  times=100))

# Visualize the difference in timing
plot(op)

# much faster!

# and, just to prove they're identical once read in, we compare the two data sets to one another with identical()
identical(data.frame(fread("test.csv")), read.csv("test.csv"))
```

If you did this with a larger dataset, say 10^6 rows long (ca. 13.8 MB), then the speed up becomes really meaningful (almost 60x faster):

```
(op <- microbenchmark(
  read.csv("test.csv"),
  fread("test.csv")))

Unit: milliseconds
                 expr        min         lq    median        uq       max neval
 read.csv("test.csv") 2844.94893 3282.67950 3440.3038 3708.6769 5758.1040   100
    fread("test.csv")   87.05953   94.19449  131.1998  169.6652  429.7068   100
```

## Combine data.frames

`data.table` can do more than just read in files though.  Another often-completed task is combining two data.frames.  Let compare the base R approach to the `data.table` version.

```{r rbindlist}
# First we'll create two distinct data frames to join together 
df1 <- data.frame(a = 1:4, b = letters[1:4])
df2 <- data.frame(a = 5:8, b = letters[5:8])

# put them into a list 
l <- list(df1, df2)

# first, the base R version:
do.call(rbind, l)

# then the data.table version, rbindlist()
rbindlist(l)
```

This too is much faster with the data.table `rbindlist()` than with the base R `rbind()`.  To show the difference, we'll do the same procedure with data.frames 1 million rows long.

```{r rbindlisttiming}
df3 <- data.frame(a = 1:10^6, b = 1:10^6)
df4 <- data.frame(a = 1:10^6, b = 1:10^6)
l <- list(df3, df4)

system.time( do.call(rbind, l) )
system.time( rbindlist(l) )

microbenchmark(
  do.call(rbind, l),
  rbindlist(l))
# as you can see, rbindlist() is many times faster than base R's rbind() function
```

## Fast manipulation

Data table inherits from data.frame.  That means that `data.table` objects can also be used in functions that require data frames.  In addition, however, data.table objects can also be accessed with a completely different syntax, that is in many ways similar to SQL queries.  

The general syntax is (where DT is a data.table):    
`DT[where,select|update,group by][having][order by][ ]...[ ]`

This syntax enables all sorts of powerful manipulations and subsetting of data.tables, but one simple application of this that we describe here is that using this `data.table` syntax, you can perform fast manipulation of subsets of `data.table` objects.  In base R, the `tapply()` function is often used to calculate sums, means, or other statistics on the data in one column based on the categorical values in a second column, but in `data.table` this is built in to the syntax.  You can check out [this link](http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/datatable-faq.pdf) for more info.

We'll need the `diamonds` dataset from the `ggplot2` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


```{r grouping}
# first we make a data.table object and fill it with some random numbers
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
diamonds_dt <- data.table(diamonds)
# DT <- data.table(x = rep(letters, 3847), v = rnorm(100022)) 

# calculate the sum of the price column (leaving the first argument blank applies the sum() function over all rows)
diamonds_dt[,sum(price)]

# calculate the sum of the values in the price column, grouped by the categorical values in the color column
diamonds_dt[,sum(price),by=color]

# More than 3 times faster than tapply(). Because both functions are pretty fast, we replicate sthe function calls 100 times to show the difference.
microbenchmark(
  tapply=tapply(diamonds$price, diamonds$color, sum),
  data.table=diamonds_dt[,sum(price),by=color],
  times=100)
```


## Some common tasks in both Base R and data.table

Task | Base R  | data.table
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Creation | data.frame(...) | data.table(...)
Select column | x[,"column"]  | x[,column]
First 6 rows | head(x)  | head(x)
Grouping | tapply(x$col1,x$col2,sum) | x[,sum(col1),by=col2]
Combine two data.frame's | rbind(df1,df2) | rbindlist(list(df1,df2))
Merge data.frame's | merge(df1,df2) | DT1[DT2]
