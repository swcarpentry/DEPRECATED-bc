# MATLAB teaching materials (intermediate)

## History

The first ever MATLAB bootcamp was held in Manchester in January 2014 (see [here](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5324) and [here](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/01/feedback-manchester-matlab-bootcamp.html) for blog posts about the event; the official event page is [here](http://apawlik.github.io/2014-01-14-manchester/)). The instructors from that event wrote up their teaching materials (i.e. the materials included in this `bc/intermediate/matlab/` directory) and [The MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com.au/) have released them under a [Creative Commons Attribution license](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by/).

In August 2014 a second MATLAB bootcamp was held in Melbourne, Australia. One of the instructors from the bootcamp wrote a [review of the materials](http://www.software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/08/matlab-review.html), however as yet no work has been done to update the materials on the basis of that review. 

The MathWorks have indicated that they are happy to support delivery of this course or its derivatives.

## Materials

The materials include reference files and scripts for the instructor, including step-by-step lesson plans and guides for each chapter of the course. There are also exercises with full worked solutions available. The schedule and outline can be found in the `InstructorMaterials` directory.

## Prerequisite knowledge

It's not recommended to use these materials with an audience with no previous MATLAB knowledge (i.e. these are intermediate level materials). As pre-work for the bootcamp, the authors strongly recommend the [interactive online tutorial](https://www.mathworks.co.uk/academia/student_center/tutorials/) that is available free of charge for academic users. This contains more than three hours of introductory MATLAB materials and provides suitable prerequisite training prior to attendance at an intermediate-level MATLAB-based bootcamp.
