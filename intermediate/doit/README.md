title: Automating an analysis pipeline using doit
level: intermediate
---

The aim of this lesson series is to replicate the material covered by the current 'make' lessons, but showing how to accomplish similar things with the doit library for python.

There are currently three lessons of approximately 10 minutes each. Each lesson has a set of challenges that should take around 5 minutes in total.

The lessons assume that learners have all of the python knowledge covered in our novice lessons, plus additional knowledge of python dictionaries. Knowledge of python generators would also be very beneficial - there is some coverage of generators in these lessons but it might need to be expanded depending on the audience.
