GNU Make comes with a comprehensive [manual](https://www.gnu.org/s/make/manual/).
For more advanced users, the chapter
[Quick Reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Quick-Reference.html)
is indensable, because it provides a condensed list of all the cryptic variables
like `$<`, `$@`, `$+`, etc.

> When running on Linux, the manual can be accessed with `info make`.

---------------------------------

For large projects, one might be inclined to have a separate
`Makefile` in every directory. This is fine, as long as the Makefiles are combined into one used `include` (see [Variables](04-variables.html)).
It is not acceptable to invoke `make` recursively, in a style that
used to be popular, but should be avoided.

---------------------------------

In the beginning of this tutorial it was mentioned that other programs
interface with `make`. Makefiles are often generated by other
programs, instead of being written by hand. This is done to deals with
portability issues and solve the problem of configuration, something
that `config-lab.mk` and `config-home.mk` were used for in the
tutorial. Two biggest implementations of this funcitonality are
[cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) and [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/s/automake/)
+ [Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/). The first
one is a bit easier to use, the second one more popular and powerful.
Those are probably better options for *compiling of software*, for
projects that are intented to be widely distributed, than bare Makefiles.

---------------------------------

For Python programs, a language specific options are usually better.
They require very little configuration for simple Python projects, and
integrate with centralized distribution systems like (PyPI)[http://pypi.python.org/].
